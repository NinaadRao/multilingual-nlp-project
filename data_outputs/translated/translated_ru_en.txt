FANO of Russia to hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert Session "Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Activities of Scientific Organizations".
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings conducted by the agency during the year, according to a press release received from the "Lente.Ru" editorial office.
At the third meeting it is planned to summarize the work of the Expert Session for the year and to form the final list of indicators for the evaluation of the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for evaluating the work of the scientific groups, and the criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in the series of events to form a common approach for all three academies to the methodology of evaluating the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months we have been able to do so, and the final version of the regulatory documents is under discussion.
Following the results of the upcoming session, we should complete the formation of the processes of scientific and expert analysis, agree on stages and deadlines for the evaluation," said Elena Aksenova, Head of the expert and analytical department of the FANO of Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than 100 scientific institutions of Russia.
It is expected that the resolution will be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: 14 Solyanka Street, Moscow.
Scientists have found a way to detect parent stars
Astrophysicists from the University of California, Santa Cruz studied turbulent mixing and its influence on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow to search among stars related, i.e. originated from one cluster.
The results of their research have been published in the journal Nature and can be found on the university website.
The same chemical composition of nearby stars is due to the turbulent mixing of gas clouds prior to the formation of stars.
Even if a born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can be determined by the place of its birth and region of formation of parent stars.
Earlier scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of its relatives in the cluster.
The results of the modeling carried out by astrophysicists show that such differences should not occur.
In their research, specialists with the help of a supercomputer modeled two streams of interstellar gas, which together formed a cloud.
For several million years, this object under its own gravity is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added paint marks to the initial gas flows and found that high degrees of chemical homogeneity were achieved by rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud.
As astrophysicists believe, their research proves that it is possible to search for parent stars by chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of formation of such objects.

Lavrov: Russia will not "close the door" due to new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not "hit the door" in connection with the new sanctions.
This was stated today by the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking to the students and teachers of the Moscow State University.
On our response measures in case of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even speculate, fantasize, because everything should be specifically calculated, - he said.
And when we understand what the European and American partners will like this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not be related to knocking on doors, some insults, misunderstood, - the Minister stressed.
We will, above all, deviate from our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of partners on the subject of their adequacy, contractability and reliability.
Following the steps that are taken in the sphere of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what the partners are achieving, - continued the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry.
If they say with a loud voice that "these sanctions will also be painful for us, but we are forced to go there to punish Russia", it is probably not very adequate."
As for Russia’s withdrawal from the WTO in response to possible new sanctions, it is not.
On the contrary, we want to become more actively familiar with the tools of the WTO, including when it comes to trade disputes,” Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome, in our view, the EU’s discriminatory policy towards anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of dumping and at the same time apply anti-dumping measures against the industries of the Russian economy.
"We are ready to use the mechanisms of the WTO and to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the third energy package of the EU retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How to use syrup properly in garden design?
Irina Okineva answers the questions:
Since the seedling loses its basic attractiveness after blooming, it is desirable to plant it together with other shrubs.
It is perfectly combined with many cultures.
Besides, it is possible and necessary to plant both plants, decorative in other times, and flowers simultaneously with the siren.
Another plus of the cheese is that it provides a lot of possibilities for creativity.
You can form it with a steamboat tree of different heights, an improved bush, a bush with a broad base and even a garden bonsai - a tree with a strangely curved trunk.
Just choose the shape that best suits the design of your garden.
A resident of Leningrad Oblast convicted in Karelia for the sale of counterfeit money
According to the republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal activities in Олонetsk and Segezh districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in the Volgograd region, where in spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Opole District Court.
In order to complete the investigation of crimes committed in our republic, it was staged in Szeged.
In the course of the investigation, the guilt was proven for several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money related to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the materials of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court issued a decision to replace the sentence of imprisonment for four years with detention in a general regime colony.
The sentence did not enter into force.
Recall, last week two other sellers of counterfeit money, which they distributed in Petrozavodsk stores, were convicted.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them was imprisoned for five years, the other for four.
A fine of 500 thousand rubles was imposed on each person.
The sentence has not yet entered into force.
In Arkhangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the parish of the first convoy "Derвиш"
The meeting, which took place in the regional center, was devoted to the first Arctic expedition.
"Derвиш" delivered military aid to the USSR from the United States and Great Britain.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally was held at the site of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov Harbour in Solombal.
Representatives of veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from Cadet class gathered for the event.
We gathered for the first time twenty-three years ago, when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who have not been returned by the sea," Chairman of the Council of Veterans of the North Sea Shipping Boris Karpov noted.
Then at the event the city spiritual orchestra performed, and pupils of cadet classes gave flowers to veterans and marched with the flags of Russia and the flag of Victory.
The meeting ended with the laying of flowers on the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tonnes of rubber, 1,500 tonnes of molded shoes, oil, wool, and many other equipment and supplies).
In addition, on board the ships were also military equipment and weapons - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Harrican fighters, in decommissioned condition.
The convoy consisted of 16 British Navy ships, including two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of the ships was not detected by the enemy and successfully reached the destination - Arkhangelsk.
A total of 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations lost 126 transport and about 50 military vessels.

Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill that would protect trade unions as a civil right.
"There are trade unions, there are middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota who is the Co-Chairman of the Progressive Fraction Congress.
That is why I am proud to present the Employee Enlargement Act together with John Lewis, the symbol of the civil rights movement.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunities in the case of discrimination against trade unions as in other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of opponents of trade unions
Amendment of the Labour Relations Law in such a way as to allow workers facing discrimination for their participation in trade union organizations to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative – at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the co-authors of the bill are proposing is to remember a very American idea.
Despite the attacks on trade unions in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country – Americans once supported countries around the world in adopting, expanding, and respecting labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military dictatorship of Hideyoshi Tojo was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize, to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and heard in the new state, the Germans included an article which openly stated: "The right to form associations with the aim of protecting and improving labour and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or sphere of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will not have legal force; measures aimed at these purposes will be deemed illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, to be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the composers included a guarantee that "everybody has the right to organize and join trade unions to defend their interests."
Generations of Americans have accepted as the right basic position that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions – and to have this trade union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government institutions – must be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and that their voices should be heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King the Younger said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the power of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions, the trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack the trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers as we should.
Official recognition of labour rights as human rights – and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against trade unions – is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
A judge temporarily blocks a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the implementation of Louisiana law, about which his supporters say he would most likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under this measure, which was signed to be implemented by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and was due to enter into force on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have authority to admit patients to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge’s ruling means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions at the moment by continuing to seek such authority.
"Others will be allowed to work legally, continuing to act to obtain powers," wrote Judge John deGravels in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled during the month in which the judge will make a more permanent decision on this law.
Advocates of abortion rights welcomed this decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital powers.
"Today's decision guarantees that Louisiana women will be protected from a corrupt law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Norton, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit against three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applies to doctors from two clinics, who did not act as complainants in this case, and also filed an application for authorization of admission.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed such laws, and courts have recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key pieces of Texas law that would shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, together with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the acceptance laws impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary from the point of view of medicine.
Opponents of abortion object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has the authority to admit him to a hospital, the Center for Reproductive Rights reported.
If all other doctors in the state would be forced to stop performing this procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing this procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for acceptance are pending a decision.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of products for each kind of goods in the assortment of trading networks should be Russian production, deputy of the State Duma from the faction "Just Russia" Oleg Nilov believes.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, the newspaper "Izvestiya" writes.
The document will be further elaborated to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. <...> For the other groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its sites to domestic producers," Nilov told the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article "On the basis of the state regulation of trade activity in the Russian Federation" the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% on the sale of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trade networks is part of a package of incentive measures for Russian producers.
There will be several times more domestic goods on the shelves.
However, the initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to lawyer of the company "Nalovik", member of the independent expert center "Public Duma" Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
Farmers, farmers and small shops will benefit.
They will be able to sell more, which means that profits will increase.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate to retailers their terms and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase the volume of their activities and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will expand, some will learn faster, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately,” the expert notes.
Earlier, Russian companies were often unable to penetrate the entrances of local shops due to high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche has been liberated and you can breathe comfortably.
But it should not be forgotten that after all necessary agreements and sanitary inspections, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, now there is a "moment of silence" when the former players have already left and the new ones have not yet come.
Almost a month later, it is possible to talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the rise in prices for finished products", - said AIF.ru the first Vice-President of the general Russian public organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors", k.e.n. Tamara Kasyanova.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will enable the sector to catch up with local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, not with goods that are cheaper at the expense of subsidies from another state.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will spread between companies operating under the common laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs of citizens by far not all articles.
And in this situation, trade networks will have to "delay" the share of Russian goods to half the assortment.
As a result, there are growing fears that poor quality goods will arrive at the entrances.
It is possible that foreign products with overwritten labels will be supplied in the form of products produced in Russia," the expert adds.
The negative effect of introducing quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that prefer to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers will also benefit from such a deployment, as demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods can also affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may be inferior in quality to imported analogues, while shops will be able to price the second as a scarce commodity.
The idea of import substitution, which was forgotten in the early 2000s, was revived by economists in February of this year due to the continuous devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the question of refusing to import products becomes even more urgent.
The law is designed to oblige retailers to treat suppliers as domestic producers when forming orders.
Then we will go much faster and more confident on the way of import substitution, and the system of production planning for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time," deputy Oleg Nilov says.
Particularly effective quota mechanism will be for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover the entrances of Russian shops.
Furthermore, meat production can get a powerful impulse.
As is known, the largest share of imports remains on beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out, 65-70% are still accounted for by Russian products", - Kasyanova argues.
Experts are of the opinion that introduction of quotas for domestic products will facilitate import substitution and may accelerate this process.
However, in itself, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, as it requires a complex of measures, Litvinenko is sure.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be imported from abroad, which means that there will be no full import substitution, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, it is not enough to set quotas, it is still necessary to set up domestic production in the country in order to meet these quotas.
These quotas will provide just such guarantees," the expert states.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video commemorating their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women protecting themselves in rural Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers analyzed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after the diagnosis.
Leading researcher Susan Jordan of the Institute of Medical Research QIMR Berghofer reported that the likelihood of dying during the study is 20 percent higher for those living in regions and remote areas of the state than for those living in urban areas.
NOTICE: New drugs can slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers followed the medical path of women for seven years.
Dr Jordan said that the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, presence of current diseases and socio-economic status also influenced the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of death during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside cities are more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr Jordan suggested that premature diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly located in big cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of outpatient services that would allow specialists to treat women closer to home, and support programs for people receiving treatment far from home, could help.
Dr Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study revealed that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, underlining the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The research, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from Gold Coast, Elise Neve, was told that she had aggressive forms of ovarian cancer.
In September, the new FAP will open its doors in Kuzhenersky District
Construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaibelek was started in April of this year and was carried out on a typical project.
The cost of the works amounted to just over 10 million rubles.
According to the management of public relations and information of Head Mari El, the financing of construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the built medical and preventive institution is almost 230 square meters.
It will provide medical assistance to the inhabitants of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaibelek and the villages of Dementyevo, Puncherumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraibelek, Shinur and Chashkayal.
The new medical clinic will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long run out of resources, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new institution will open in the near future.
The murderer of the four-month-old son in the state of incontinence of Novocheboksary will appear before the court
The resident of Chuvashia will be on the scene of the defendants for the murder of her own child.
The investigation of a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksary accused of causing death by negligence has been completed in Cheboksary.
The investigation found that on July 26, this year, the accused came together with a four-month-old son to celebrate the birthday of the child of her cousin in Cheboksary.
After a long stand, Novocheboksary decided to stay in the guests and laid the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, the unmarried woman placed him next to her on the bed to feed her breasts, but soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, the woman fell on her son, and he died of a stroke.
The criminal case has been referred to the court, the press service of the DSU of the Republic of Artsakh in Chuvash reported.
Inflation came out of the holidays.
Will Russians feel the sharp price rise
As a result of cross-border sanctions of Russia and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not fall into the forecasts of the authorities, VTB Capital analysts are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of the anti-sanctions will lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, RBC Daily writes.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and even less - 6.5%.
However, according to the newspaper Kommersant, this week the MER should make "small but fundamental" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency may lower the estimate of inflation for 2015, which will allow to eliminate the expected strain of population income growth.
The forecast assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation will be in force for a year - until August 2015.
How could such high inflation be assumed in such a situation?
The current situation suggests a different shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," the source of the newspaper in the Ministry of Finance said.
The economists from VTB Capital do not share the government's financial and economic bloc's expectations regarding inflation and forecast price growth in 2014 at 8%.
The main effect of the food bans will come together with the possible introduction of sales tax (VAT) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflation peak of 9% will be in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will go down, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflation results after the Russian Federation introduced "accurate sanctions".
AIF.ru asked experts and found their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the analytical department of FC AForex:
Price increases are already observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially important products became more expensive, the government was forced to introduce systemic price stability monitoring measures to prevent the risks of unjustified price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already accounted for on a daily basis before regulators, so that the authorities know exactly who, when, and for what reason initiates price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous rates of capital outflows, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, internal conversion due to the population flight to foreign currency, as well as the embargo on imports of food products from countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure had remained under control, the price of a basket of the minimum set of products would not have jumped by 12% in just one quarter.
The ban on imports of foodstuffs provoked a supply shock in the domestic market and led to a perfectly logical increase in the final cost.
Since at the current stage we fail to fully implement the import substitution mechanism, as well as increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, the response sanctions will continue to carry risks of inflationary component growth.
If we add to this the fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the worsening prospects for economic growth, inflation could well exceed 8% by the end of this year.
Alexander Razuvayev, Director of the analytical department of "Alpari"
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, in zero it was also higher than the current level, another thing that was then compensated by rapid economic growth.
I think, according to the results of the year inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Platon Maguta, Managing Director of Maguta Fund
The external factor linked to sanctions against Russia is still being successfully contained, but if further pressure is exerted, primarily on the financial sector, this may lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflation expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally expressed in cash purchases to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods, and by state regulation.
But price growth traditionally begins after the summer recess and may become more tangible this autumn.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia at 7.5% is likely to persist, as Russia still has financial savings.
Gardening centers are sorry for the decrease in number of homeowners
This decline, due to the exceptional reduction in the number of households under the age of 35, could lead to gardening centers losing tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach "the basic age of gardening," according to a study by HTA, reported by the Financial Times.
According to the report, people renting housing spend on average 55 percent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on gardening.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in high urban areas without gardens, the popularity of paved courtyards in front of a parking house, and the reduction in garden sizes as other factors threatening the industry, which is estimated to have annual sales of £5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, the UK’s lowest level of household consumption of garden goods.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society reported that renting housing and lack of garden space did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening advisor at RHS, said: "Container planting, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of retail trade in horticultural goods as a result of the increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has carried out a mass cleaning in the Fund "Agriculture"
Three of the four heads of the “Zemleделиe” fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Farming Foundation were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture only announced the dismissal of the executive director Atanas Добреv.
His place was taken by Lausanne Vasiliev.
It turned out that on Friday two of the three deputy executive directors of the foundation were quietly replaced.
Tatiana Angelova, deputy executive director, who until now was in charge of state aid and SAPARD program, has been released, reports BGNES with reference to the newspaper "Labour".
I was not present on the board of directors of the fund because by law we are not members of the management, but I was later informed that I was released.
I cannot say why my dismissal is not reported on the Foundation website.
I am on vacation.
I hope to learn more on Monday," Angelova told the press.
She will be replaced by Ivanka Baghdatova, who has until now been the head of Investment Crediting in the central fund in “Zemleделиe” in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the Fund "Zemledeliye" in the city of Great Ternovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the foundation Atje Aliyeva-Veli has retained his post.
Currently it is responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey summons American diplomat in connection with report of espionage
The Turkish Foreign Ministry summoned the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that an American prosecutor and Turkish officials discussed the message on Monday.
German magazine "Der Spiegel" and Internet magazine "The Intercept" reported that documents provided by former analyst of the U.S. National Security Agency Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the significance of this message, saying that all the leading countries spy on each other.
Earlier reports that the main German intelligence agency had also made Ankara an object of intelligence provoked more angry reactions from the Turkish government.
China's largest companies unite against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including the largest commercial real estate developer in China Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (network, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online market with Alibaba.
But catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left behind even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of the largest
The companies plan to invest in the joint venture 5 billion yuan ($814 million), 70% of it will be owned by Wanda and 15% - each of the Internet companies, said the Wanda Group statement.
The company is scheduled to be registered in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine Baidu's search engines with the popular social platform WeChat (China's largest social network with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, Wanda operates at least 49 commercial properties throughout China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a movie studio and a theme park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the Yellow Sea coast).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda belongs to the American theater network AMC Entertainment Holdings, making the company the largest theater operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its own shopping malls, hotels and entertainment facilities with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the newly created competitor Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will head the new company, thanks to the merger Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new platform should become the largest online-to-offline platform in the world, says Don Tse.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers to the Internet so that they come to ordinary offline stores or purchase other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O are coupon sales services such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest "pearl" in online commerce," said head Wanda Wang Jianlin ( Bloomberg quote).
"At present, there is no real O2O site in China, and in this situation the chances are approximately equal," he believes.
China’s Internet trade market is the world’s largest, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will grow more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, according to Bloomberg official statistics: this is more than the population of any country in the world except India.
And according to forecasts, by 2015 this number could rise to 850 million people.
Union of the Richest
The head of Tencent Ma Huatan until recently was the richest person in China, however, according to Bloomberg’s index of millionaires, the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma has already surpassed him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's assets are estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion comes from his share in Alibaba.
Baidu leader Robin Li now ranks third among the richest people of China, while Wang Jianlin of Wanda - the fourth position of the rating.
"This battle is very interesting to observe: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge the even richer," said Bloomberg, director of China's e-commerce research center in Hangzhou, Cao Lai.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba immediately after its creation: "The river cannot be built in one day."
It is not easy to compete with Alibaba, not only for new companies, but also for well-deserved global internet market leaders, as evidenced by the previous report on Alibaba’s financial performance for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something intermediate between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June the Chinese company earned more than both its American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profit over the period almost doubled the same cumulative indicator of competitors - it grew almost three times in the annual calculation and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has huge potential for generating money, largely thanks to its mobile applications," - commented Bloomberg report analyst from Hong Kong's Arete Research Service.
According to Alibaba’s updated prospectus on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s website, the number of active mobile users of the company’s services in July amounted to 188 million, significantly exceeding the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter were for mobile devices.
Alibaba will have to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company can be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may already take place on September 16th.
The road-show of the company, preceding this event, will start on September 3.
It is expected that Alibaba's IPO will be a record in NYSE history and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
Until now, the record amount of funds raised on the US stock exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 carried out the initial offering of its shares, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of food products in trade networks should be Russian production, deputies of the State Duma believe.
They drafted a bill on this subject.
It is about amendments to Article 8 of the Federal Law "On the Basics of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation" and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
Important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of products of domestic production in stores should be for each kind of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in the winter, so for them will be made a "discount" to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, establishing a reduced rate of VAT in the amount of 10% for the sale of all food products, the country of origin of which is Russia, the newspaper “Izvestiya” reports.
On August 27, the lower chamber of the parliament introduced a draft law on amendments to the Federal Law "On Retail Markets", which proposes to revive farming markets in Russia, where small producers will be able to sell their products.
Chief of Police of Magaloff charged with corruption
The inhabitants presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The police chief of Calvia on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested as a result of charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the notorious centre of unbridled drunkenness in Magalupe.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magalhães are located.
According to the daily online edition Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca for the fight against corruption on Friday.
Two more local police officers were arrested by the guards of the Spanish National Guard on charges of corruption and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that dissatisfied owners of nightclubs say that protectionism on the part of the authorities seriously reflects the state of their business.
"It is no longer a question of earning money, it is a question of survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Our sources of existence cannot be threatened.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaloff made international press headlines this summer after a popular YouTube video that showed an 18-year-old British vacationer leaving 24 men behind while running around bars.
The island's authorities have since attempted to stop the unhealthy hooliganism among the resting people of Magalpha, minimizing the number of notorious alcoholic bar races.
In addition, Playhouse, where the mine incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and Carnage bar racing organizers were fined €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaloff, mainly popular among young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous accidents in alcoholic state related to the insane amusement known as "balconying", when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city at night until 9 pm, following the 6.6 mm that fell on Sunday night.
The last rains were preceded by a couple of short rains with gusty winds, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured nearly 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter delivered the early portion of spring last week, the temperature dropped again on Monday to a maximum of just 15.8C in the city.
The squalor conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in boarding Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane had to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 pm, but fell into a wind shift zone - a sudden change of speed or direction of the wind at a short distance - and was forced to raise the altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
Flight data showed that the aircraft had to raise altitude during the second landing, and the aircraft finally landed at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including Emirates from Dubai and Qantas from Sydney.
Maximum 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two rains.
The accounting of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
Issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems of connection to networks are under special control of the Federal Antitrust Service.
The FAS has established an expert council for the development of competition in the construction sector.
At its meeting the head of the department of control of public utilities, construction and natural resources of the FAS Vadim Solovyev stated that "today's calculation of the construction objects list is absolutely incomprehensible".
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to unreasonable construction price, the FAS believes.
And offer to determine the cost of construction of state-owned objects at the design stage on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of the currently applied estimate norms and uniform prices for technological operations.
These proposals have been included in the road map and are now under consideration in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"The replacement of traditional estimate documentation in construction to calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," Vadim Solovyev explained.
After all, now in the account is counted every bolt and hook, and it does not always seem possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation unfair construction companies can dig "full tractors".
The Minster agrees with the FAS.
"The first developments on the transition to the calculation of the cost on the components already exist: methods for the calculation of the prices on the construction solutions, the preparation of estimates on these indicators have been developed," said Elena Zhukova, Head of the Department of Urban Development and Architecture of the Ministry of Construction.
The field of road construction was chosen as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demyanko told "RGB", the estimated standards are long outdated, but another mechanism is not yet offered to the business.
"As for the proposed calculations on the structural elements, in practice it is difficult to implement, because when buildings are often used completely different technologies," - he believes.
It is no secret that the construction market develops largely thanks to public procurement.
In the opinion of the Chairman of the Board of NPP "Expert Society of Public Procurement Professionals" Ekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most payable customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, Deputy Director of Engineering of the Russian Capital Development Branch, pointed out that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to contract portfolios and companies that have monopoly competences and do not allow competitors in this field.
He believes that creating a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is maximized by someone managing influence.
At the expert council it was proposed to form a system of public procurement in such a way that the same performer is not entitled to receive more than one contract in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry believes that this approach should be evaluated from the point of view of impact on business, as well as the efficiency of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case it will be necessary to entrust the customer with the functions of the general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the staff number of the customer and budget expenditures on its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer’s specialists will have the knowledge to evaluate the quality of the works performed by contracting organizations, as well as their safety.
Often, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to the withdrawal of highly skilled public procurement participants due to their unwillingness to receive a public order for a limited volume of work and a small amount of contract.
Deputy Head of the Expert and Advisory Center of the Institute of Procurement Alexander Evstashenkov believes that the procedure of public procurement has now turned into a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And he gave the following example: "the participant must specify "specific indicators" when filling in the application without specifying the words: "or equivalent", "must be", "from", "more", "less", "analogous", "or", "type", "analogous type", "not below", "below", "above", "may", "may have", "may be", "before", "not before", "not above", "not allowed", etc.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of an application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Evstashenkov, became the need to evaluate the quality of work through the "paper" proposal of the participant at the stage of application.
Considering the application of the participant, it is really possible to evaluate only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the works, which have not even begun to be carried out, - the expert believes.
The quality of the works can only be assessed when they are received.
The expert council also suggested shifting marginal income from top to bottom to eliminate intermediate contractors.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, Deputy Director of the FAS Andrey Tsarikovsky believes that this should not be done, as the contractor is responsible for the order.
Otherwise it will happen, as in the famous reprimand of Arkady Rikin "Atel": "There are claims to buttons?".
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in areas adjacent to the Gaza Strip went to school again on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and rain mines fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the area recovered after the fighting.
The beginning of school classes brought a sense of joy and excitement to the rocket-affected settlements of southern Israel, but the effects of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashosh kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed the marks of shells from the walls and children's wheels before the arrival of the students.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re looking forward to the future,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibutsa Sad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a life of scale.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said she suddenly started to go to school again "not very strange".
"It was a difficult time, and we did not leave our homes at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibutz, which is located near the border with Gaza, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Sa'ad did not take to the streets or leave their homes, moving to safer areas beyond the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the border with Gaza where a four-year-old boy was killed by a cluster of Palestinian mines, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families still have not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza that was heavily damaged by the Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study diligently and said, "We will do everything possible to give you knowledge and ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an immediate ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately ended the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas' demand that the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza be lifted and that airports and seaports be opened in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
It is expected that a new phase of indirect negotiations will begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2100 Palestinians, three quarters of whom were peaceful citizens, and at least 494 children, were killed in the war, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; however, it has not provided substantive evidence to support this claim.
Israeli casualties included 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting Hamas and other Gaza fighters fired 4591 missiles and mines on Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people have found shelter in more than 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
Due to the fact that tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, officials responsible for education delayed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope that the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as children from all over the world and Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza’s schools.
According to the popular criterion of real estate prices showed the biggest winter growth in seven years.
The housing price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase resulted in a aggregate increase of 4.2 percent in June, July and August, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth amounted to 10.9 percent, more than double the 12 month growth by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
Research Director of RP Data Tim Lauless said that Sydney and Melbourne have a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that Sydney’s housing prices have risen by 16.1 percent over the past year, while Melbourne’s – by 11.7 percent.
The following markets were Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, where prices rose from five to six percent on average.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government spending cuts occurred, where prices rose by only 1.4 percent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of real estates on sale over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Taking into account the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will rise in the next three months," he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former house of gold producers and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on October Revolution Street 57/1 (the former Bolshoy Kazanskaya) 18 apartments.
The 18th-century house has not changed much since it was built, except for its old age.
The outsiders walk here as if on an excursion, and the inhabitants suffer more than rejoice from their privilege - the right to live in the old Ufim house, whose walls will be remembered by Colonel Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is uncertain, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is less than 300 years old.
The old courtyard, always open door, swinging staircase.
The doors of the apartments are located close to each other, the walls have cracked, and the street can be seen in the lights from the covered plaster.
It seems that everything is kept to the honest word.
And the inhabitants of the land say, "It does not seem to you that it is so."
It is very difficult to live in an 18th-century wooden house, says Tatiana Lukianova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on state reserve, but the money for its maintenance is not spent for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits, which the authorities simply forgot.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls were still tight, but the foundations were all burned.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street and bathe once a week in the public bath.
How can we be satisfied in such conditions?!
The road passes directly under the windows, there is not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana moves the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before: under the windows there is a flow of cars.
You can see that the windows are always cracked, we can't open the windows, and we're used to noise.
Man is used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to the husband, his hands are gold.
Moreover, we have two rooms, we live in three with our son.
And in other families the conditions are much worse, on the second floor in general ceilings are slightly more than one and a half meters high.
For contrast Tatiana offers to enter the guest to the neighbor from apartment No 6 Ludmila Starostina.
A pleasantly hospitable woman from the front offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile tells:
We have one bedroom apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, so we live: we with husband and daughter with granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, there has never been another flat, - Lyudmila turns her eyes around the room: an antennas, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them lay a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and little different from the usual domestic interior: only ceilings beautiful, "historic".
But from the ceiling regularly flows: the water supply system is no use.
Lyudmila talks about her apartment as usual and astonishingly simultaneously as an Italian woman whose house stands on Roman ruins.
That is, it merges into one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water pipeline was completed about 40 years ago during the last renovation.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the dining room and a toilet from the former cellar.
We live exactly where Demidov and his family lived, on the second floor there were servants.
Our apartment is not private, and why?
The Ufa Property Center says that privatization is not important.
However, we will only get a one-bedroom apartment, we cannot claim a larger one.
Four months ago, we were promised to settle, but no further promises were made.
I'm not used to complaining and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandmother with grandfather, mother with father, I with husband and my daughter with granddaughter.
Everything happened during this time.
For example, healthy rats ran around the kitchen.
Look at the steel walls, they are meters thick!
It is said that the solution was mixed on the eggs, so it holds so long.
The house is built thoroughly, thank you Demidov!
Probably, that's the only reason no one has been killed by the collapsed ceiling or porch.
Only the construction is still slowly dying in our eyes: the boards and logs of the house are rotting, the floors have fallen repeatedly, we have poured cement, but all is useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
It is said that it is - under our room a secret climb and a walk to the White River, which was made specially by the old men who once lived here, to be able to hide from danger, if necessary.
They were persecuted.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how a historian came to them, pleaded to let him start the excavation in the apartment.
And then he persuaded them to give them a flat in exchange for their one-room apartment on the Avenue of October.
Lyudmila refused to tell the historian:
Where are we four in one?
And here though there is a small hope that will give housing more spacious.
If we agree to exchange, we won't win anything.
However, the family did not win anything.
The biggest dream of Ludmila was to have them displaced, and the daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter were given a separate room.
That is, two families were divided into two-room apartments instead of the not the most magnificent ruins in which two generations live now.
The charming, miniature girl Olesya Karsakova from apartments No 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There is a large family living in two cozy 23 m2 flats called apartments.
We are seven people, two children.
You can see what the conditions are.
As with window frames, the scaffolding is washed away by pieces, with holes in the kitchen walls and in the rooms.
The water in the tap is only cold all year round.
If you walk through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can be sure that the most fortunate of the spouses of Lavrentyev from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You are right, there are plenty of places!
The accommodation is 75 square meters and has three people.
We live in exactly the rooms where Suvorov was supposed to stay during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitryevich Lavrentyev.
The roofs are high, spacious.
One bad thing - everything around cracks, breaks down, breaks down.
The neighbors probably already told!
Most of our suffering is with the floors: wooden boards burned, the ground literally went from under our feet.
I put the supports, the cords; nothing else in the hall, and in the other room we walk, as we climb on the swings, so it is all tense.
Alexander Dmitrievich can tell about the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov better than any guide.
The gold industry refers to it as the native, speaks about it with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was unruly: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzansky factories built houses, poured guns and bells, held Ural mines.
The ancestors of the merchant real estate ancestor are proud, but do not want to live under one roof with history anymore.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the 20th century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then around stood wooden spaces for carts, horses and caravans, later demolished.
In 1968 they wanted to remove our house too, but something prevented...
The story repeated in 2014: once again they were seized by new housing.
We, as a team, gathered all the documents, took care of the necessary authorities, and suddenly learned that the move to the apartment is being moved to 2015 or 2016.
We don't believe in all this anymore...
Two years ago Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The officers did not accept the residence.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a joke, gave out a paper without signature and seal: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the displacement of residents."
I even had the feeling that our house is no longer in the city plan, after all it was under number 57, then became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It was demolished in the 1970s.
"Russian Planet" has contacted Vladimir Barabash, head of the information and analytical work of the Ufa Land Resources Department.
The house on October Revolution Street 57/1 is included in the program of demolition of old housing.
I cannot answer for the actions of officials of the 1970s, only know that at that time there was a plan to destroy all old houses, despite historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses on October Revolution Street, representing architectural value - is successfully carried out.
Residents are expected to move to new apartments in the near future.
According to Barabash, the restoration of Dom Demidov will be carried out by Italian specialists who have participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Now in Italy there is an architectural biennale, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire old Kazan street will be restored, - says the official.
The houses will have a proper view, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
Dom Demidov is likely to become a museum open to all.
In addition, the government decided to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
In the morning, unfortunately, it will not work, too much traffic in the city.
To resettle people from the future museum Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be on the same square as the present ones.
Only from another era.
A forest fire started in Primorsky due to a thunderstorm
The drought caused a forest fire on the territory of the Hunting Precinct Forestry in the Fire District of the Primorsky Krai.
At the site of the burning there is an increase in the grouping of forces and means.
According to the management of the Coastal Aviation Base, the conditions created on the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Chief of the Air Base:
The fire, which broke out in an inaccessible area, was detected by a surveillance pilot on board the patrol aircraft An-2 on an area of 3 hectares.
The wooden remains are burned on the old burner.
The high humidity of the area and the steep slopes of more than 45 degrees, the absence of suitable firefighter landing sites create considerable difficulties in shaving.
A Mi-8 helicopter is required.
The delivery of the forces at the disposal of the airbase by helicopter Mi-2 and aircraft An-2 is very difficult.
After the fire was detected, four parachute firefighters were immediately deployed to the site.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional fire fighting forces and means.
In the area of lunch to the area of the village of Ochotnichy helicopter additionally delivered 3 firefighters.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the area of the fire is ready, specialists will be moved to the site of the blaze, the website of the administration of the Primorsky Krai reports.
Lenny Henry: My father never humiliated me.
Never said, "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children born to a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry reprises the comedy, "Rudy's Lower Plates", which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of rap and rap, and the melodies are lively.
However, Henry had to go through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death there were "many" treatments, besides, Henry often reflects on his relationship with his father.
It was very inaccessible.
You never saw his face, you only heard his voice: "Stop making noise.
Get away from your sister.
Have fun!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were grown up when I was a kid, went to pubs with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer cup, the beauty of a kick in a cricket.
I never talked to him that way.
He was such a smiling guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a pottery shop in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than in his father's days, he was able to look at what his life must have been like.
Now there is not much better, but it is dark, smoky, depths of labyrinths with flashes of fire and smoke and a dog of sage.
My father was in the bathroom and just lying there, and you heard him slowly singing about himself because he wanted to wash himself from the clay shop.
When I came there, I realized that he had been doing it for years and years to earn us food, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry left childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never denied, never said, "I love you."
Only when mom got sick at the end of her life, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Just stop embracing me!
Daddy, I'm 22!
Don Frank.
Why should I not be friends with her?
She's a great mom
They are still great friends with Frank, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why should I not be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So when I was very, very well and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
The change in Henry's career trajectory is probably reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since he received the acclaim of critics for his Otella, he has completely immersed himself in the theatre.
It was followed by the "Feed of Errors" and then by the "Forces" by August Wilson.
This work differs from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his saturated professional life.
He began his career when he was 16 and worked at a factory.
DJ noticed him parodying on stage and wrote about him in New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-'70s: "For quite a long time I was the only black parody/comedian on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in "New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager had rights to the "Black and White Show of Shooters", a light entertainment program in which people "blackened their faces," Henry discovered that he performed in it for five years.
My family did not like it very much.
I don't want it ever to happen to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked on large platforms and learned to work with crowds.
But what was "a rewarded light entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also "a grotesque parody of black people".
Presenting characters who both cheered on and sang about the culture of blacks in the UK, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of "Lanni Henry Show" aired in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, chef Gary Blacklock from the comedy series "Shef!".
Advertisement, documentary, television series, and film roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008 "LennyHenry.tv", he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it doesn't seem like you're dragging time or slowly turning aside."
Later, there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's Good in...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
It’s hard to say that I was taught this at school, and I thought it was largely a prerogative of white middle-class people with hips and caps at the bottom of the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try.
Don't handle it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words aloud and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from the last Otello monograph for a documentary transmission, and he was caught.
I had the feeling that I could do it.
My head will be straightened.
"Look what it is, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, study your text, do a little research.
So, the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it up.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for a catastrophe, and it did not happen.
Soon we started the "Corruption Comedy".
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the public.
"The quiet voice inside me said, "You'll have to work for 10 minutes until they clean up the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the performance would resume once the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
This is not my duty.
I can let someone else deal with it.
"You're playing a play, stay in the role."
Henry in "Zaborah" in the theatre of Dachess
It was difficult to learn the text for "Fortresses".
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens muscles.
It was also accepted well, so that it was as a sign from above, indicating, "This is what you must do."
He says this, of course, with a loud voice.
So I keep it.
I really love it.
I love to be in the rehearsal hall.
By the way, Henry still thinks like a comic - all the way through our conversation there are flashes of his humor, when he starts, then he ends parodying.
I just decided not to work in the stand, because this thing with instant rewards from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you pursue this all the time, it can lead to a stalemate.
I sometimes work on the air in Apollo when I want, but mainly I don't get as much pleasure as before.
I wonder if he will give a stand-up tour ever again.
The joy of sitting in the room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the journey - I don't think I would ever want to give up.
Is that his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It is a pleasant pleasure.
You always tell a story, and here is the perfect place for it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify "invisible workers"
Kenya has started a biometric registration of all civil servants in an attempt to remove "invisible workers" from the government's payment notification.
Employees who are not registered for the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the government statement states.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the state service.
President Uharu Kenyata promised to reduce corruption in government structures after coming to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) a month is lost due to payments to "invisible workers" and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that wages continue to flow into bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves state service, reports BBC reporter Vanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants must appear in the identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected by biometric registration procedure, is reported in the government statement.
Anyone who fails to do so without a decent reason will be removed from the payment notice and will be informed thereof.
"This procedure will significantly facilitate the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear the payment accounts at both levels of government - hence ending the problem of 'invisible workers'," said Ann Weiguru, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers for Planning and Power Structuring.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", local news agencies reported.
Police officials did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daly News.
Some of them participated in corruption detection activities last December, which were aimed at checking government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organised criminal group and listening to a telephone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of measures taken against him and other in power, Islamic cleric Fatullah Gülen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most parts of Ukraine opened their doors again on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a great event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools were reopened, but that he would do his utmost to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky above every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
All Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian People's Front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastohov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, to which Yatsenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally settle down here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Ron Feyred, the BBC may have found such an inspiring leader that she needs
Behind it is a shaft of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal circles of Tori Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
She began her career at Bain and Co, a global management consulting firm, and then moved on to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearsons in the media world.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a senior position at Pearson's headquarters was taken over by a lower-ranking male colleague.
It is said that her salary is close to £1 million.
Its political rating is also satisfactory.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring private-sector specialists to Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband was a former adviser to Tori.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman’s job a poisoned cup.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life, but in its structure there is an internal paradox.
The council has two directions: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outside as a voice of public concern and anxiety when something goes wrong.
This is an almost insurmountable duality that requires a complete radical reform.
However, which new chairman would risk coming in, strangling and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he himself lost his job in the process.
This is a difficult solution.
It would not be so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC cut in size - after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
As competitors squeeze the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, inevitable licensing negotiations pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British buy a stake in what is undoubtedly the largest copper company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that the results of its work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them just 40p a day.
Moreover, it is obvious that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
Models of viewing and using the BBC have changed: now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and inspiring institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope it found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone outside
A tweet from the confirmed account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday evening contained an insulting image of the District Prosecutor from the Democrats, who is at the center of criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another one from Perry's account, in which it was deactivated.
Just from my account was posted a tweet that was written by someone outside.
"I don't like this tweet, and I removed it," says a later note.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to messages asking to comment.
Although the recordings were downloaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was not clear who was actually publishing the tape.
An earlier tweet contained a mock caricature of District Attorney Travis Rosemarie Lemberg, who was found guilty of driving drunk in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding her agency when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The signature in the tweet reads: "I don't always drive a car in a state of drunkenness 3 times the permissible alcohol level in the blood... but when I do that, I charge Governor Perry for what he tells me about it."
I am the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg did not conduct an investigation involving a grand jury against Perry.
It was appointed by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry did not plead guilty and called the accusations political mischief.
His powerful legal team asked the judge conducting the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute a governor who has been serving his duties for the longest time in the history of Texas would reveal that it was contrary to the constitution.
Perry stopped funding $7.5 million from the state's Public Control Department, which is based in Travis County and investigates corruption in the Texas public sector, when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto prompted an official complaint from the left-wing public control group.
Perry's confirmed account tape is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
Arriving fifth at the party congress in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to rumors that he might be out of the game by posting a tweet with a picture of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to "normal condition"
One of London’s most famous developers warned that the real estate market in south-eastern England has “returned” to normal activity.
Houses in the capital were the subject of intense demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble would push the Bank of England to impose mortgage restrictions in June.
Tony Pagely, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday, "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to a normal level of transactions since the peak of 2013," adding that this has provided "a stable working environment".
The London real estate market succeeded during the recession as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped by 18.5 percent just last year, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly surpassed the average figure of 6.7 percent in England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for Berkeley private, affordable, and student schemes rose by about a fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the pound’s strengthening in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped introducing new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential “home tax” ahead of the general election next May.
Last week, the London real estate agency Foxtons warned that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced tougher loan terms, would also result in a decline in market growth both in real estate purchases and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its 2015 London real estate price growth forecast to 3 percent on the basis that real estate prices are already starting to weaken.
Meanwhile, transaction volumes dropped by a quarter compared to the previous year in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the demand for houses in the capital proved very profitable for Berkeley, increasing sales by more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pigley added: "The demand for the right product with the best design and the best location remained the same and, reflecting this, the long-term sales remained."
In June, the company reported that it sold 3742 new houses this year until the end of April - almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 percent compared to the previous year to £380 million, income - by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgeley said that Berkeley’s projected revenues for this year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, the profit for the whole year before tax is expected to be £450 million.
Berkeley stocks were held at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange in the second half of the day.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence posted on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
Photos of naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a "catalog" of photos of another 100 rising stars.
A representative of the star of "Voice Games" confirmed that Lawrence's photos are real, and condemned the hacker for "gross invasion of personal space".
There has been an appeal to the law enforcement authorities, and they will prosecute anyone who publishes stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the 4chan photo sharing site were allegedly obtained due to a lack of Apple iCloud's online storage system, and the alleged victims' "catalog" includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted, and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is unclear how many of these photographs are authentic, although the star of "Scott Pilgrim Against All" Winsted on Twitter also condemned the abuse.
"Those who look at the photos that we took with my husband a few years ago, away from home, - I hope you'll be proud of yourself," Winsted wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justine of the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victory-Winner" denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These are so-called photos of me naked FALSE, people.
Let me stop at the beginning. *Calambur intentional*.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos on which she is allegedly authentic.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's novel about love and the letter "J", which has been praised by critics
They dissolved, best to say, they gradually collapsed, like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only sometimes did the woman tell him that he was too serious, too hard to communicate, too tense, too closed, and perhaps a little irritating.
And then she pressed his hand.
He saw an irritation in himself.
He was as stubborn as a goat, yes.
The last victim of this gathering was a small novel, from which he expected more than usual, a liberation from the lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eleanor Solomons was a tremendously fragile beauty with curly hair and a troubled heart from a northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Robben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevern considered her aunt, while the latter inherited a house in a cheese-like but paradise-like valley under the joyful name "The Valley of Paradise".
No one lived in the house for several years.
The trees were flowing, the bugs in the bathrooms were sitting still, the slugs left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden grew with twigs like giant cockroaches.
It was like a children's book cottage, both frightening and enchanting, with a full garden of secrets.
Author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included on the Long List of the 2014 Booker Prize.
Shortlist to be announced next week
Kevern and Eileen were sitting, holding hands, in broken chairs among the high grass, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring day; they were both separately connected to the cheap console that supplied the country with deafening music and soothing news, when, looking at her shattered brown legs, he recalled the old song of a long-forgotten black performer whom his father loved to hear when he let down the curtains in the house.
You have too big legs.
Due to their aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer lost on the console.
They were not banned - nothing was actually banned - they simply did not lose them anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic" itself.
Public taste did what would never have been achieved by orders and prescriptions, and just as among books people chose memoirs of rich people who grew up in poverty, cookbooks and love novels, they chose ballads from all music.
Dressed up that day, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and sing the big legs of Eileen with a crude comic voice.
Alain did not understand.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he told her, mechanically applying two fingers to her lips.
This is what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it fell off his lips.
It started with a game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with "J", forget to put two fingers on your mouth, and it will cost you penny.
It was not a very fun game then, and it was not very fun now.
He knew that they were waiting for him, and that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jazz were not allowed to play either, although it was not openly banned.
The improvisation came out of fashion.
Only one "if" remains in life.
When the melody began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same is true of intelligence.
His unpredictability affected people's nerves.
And jazz was an astonishment expressed through music.
Although he had never heard of Sammy Davis Jr. at the age of 10, he knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But even though he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, and that meant that every segment of it agreed with gratitude - gratitude to those saved by fate - with the principle of group preference.
People of African-Caribbean origin by temperament and physical characteristics were well suited for the sphere of entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
The Indians, as if naturally talented in everything relating to electronics, sought to ensure that no family would be left without a working electronic phone.
What remained of the Polish diaspora was used for sanitary works; what remained of the Greeks was a plate.
Expatriates from the Persian Gulf and Levant, whose grandfathers did not hastily leave the country when what happened, if anything, happened, in fear that they would be accused of burning fire, in fear, in fact, that the fire would swallow them up, opened restaurants with bars and cabins, did not rise and run away from misery.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads before, it was difficult for Eileen to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just spoken to her could be put onto the music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," Kevern said.
Perhaps for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he hated this song.
He said too much, but the open garden gave him an illusion of security.
No word could penetrate through the sound isolation of giant leaf-like capsules.
She did not understand anyway.
How could your father love such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he didn't want to touch his lips again with it.
She thought he was strange.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She shook her head incredulously, closing Keverna's view.
In the whole world there was nothing but the copies of her issy black hair.
Nothing he would like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining in her mind.
But that still doesn't explain why you're eating it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The boats, maybe, a little bit...
And thou sayest that thou hatest me, because my loins are too thick?
Will I not see you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you have thick boots," he tried to say instead.
I have such a turnaround.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to make jokes often put him in unpleasant situations because, like his father, he lacked the soothing enchantment that could mitigate the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevin, wanted it too.
Despite good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and got up from the couch, turned over the table and poured the wine they had been drinking.
The wine of purple, so that drunkenness could not serve as an excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
Even if you don't like it.
He was sorry for her, both because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She did not talk to him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he did not doubt that in the main features she was similar to the local.
The same huge ice ocean collapsed on both of them.
The same deceived men, even more sensitive and curious after what happened, if it happened, than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, roamed in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise their hands on any woman who would dare to deny them or provoke them.
A thin head?
They would have shown her a stupid fist if she hadn't been careful!
First they would kiss - the kiss has now become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote of the fresh beads that the console gave - first kiss her and then hit.
This is an exaggeration, in Kevin's opinion, because the kiss itself was already an act of hooliganism.
Alain Solomons told the Corps that he needed to leave.
He got up from his couch like an old man.
She herself felt the lead weight, but the weight of his hotness surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the upper window she watched him leave, and her companion was a man who had lifted his own weight.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a sting of compassion towards him and the men in general, even though some of them raised their hand on her.
The man who had turned away from her, with a stiff back, ashamed, stricken, all his ability to fight had left him - why did she feel that she knew it so well, if she could not remember any occasion, until today, when she would have seen it?
Another woman, Eileen Solomons, looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the above-mentioned events or so, Esme Nussbaum, a wise and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Offnau, the unofficial public mood control agency, prepared a small report on the preservation of low and medium levels of violence in the very areas of the country where it was expected to decline, if not completely, given the resources and powers allocated to eradicate it.
"Many things have been done, and many things are being done," she wrote, "to ease the inherent aggression of the people who fought in thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow divisions of the region, where, despite the temples hanging over the suburbs, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt throughout history.
Some qualities, however, turn out to be irreversible.
The higher the spine seems, the lower the passions it generates.
The population pours tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories of overcome obstacles and declares its fierce faith in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does old brutality preserve its strong grip in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is evidence that new and evil bullying is emerging in homes, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have a boring habit of writing too much," said its scientific head, reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Emmy Nussbaum dropped her head.
I must also ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I am obliged to answer," answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Emma insisted again on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," finally said Luther Rabinovitz, "not because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
Here we have no prejudices.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity, which are totally acceptable and praiseworthy in themselves, can sometimes distort results, such as those you have shown me.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced against the Church, and what you call "evil" and "scum" would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To continue to talk about what happened if it happened, as if it happened yesterday, is to deprive the country of the vitality it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked at the sides as Rabinovitz spoke.
Behind his head, the pink, flamingo-like, LED letters repeated the advice that Offnau gave the country in the last quarter of the century or more.
Look after your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talk is better than silence, the word of a song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly when she found out that her scientific director had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been cured as effectively as we believe.
What worries me is that if we are not prepared, we will find that we repeat the mistakes that originally led to what happened, if nothing happened.
Only this time will we cast our anger and distrust not on others.
Luther Rabinovitz joined the ends of his fingers into the pyramid.
This gesture was meant to mean infinite patience.
"You are going too far," he said, " naming the actions that our grandfathers did or did not do as 'errors'.
You go too far when you say that they have thrown their "rage" and "incredulity" at "others".
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that by understanding the past, that is, by defending the present, we are not talking about "we" and "they".
There were no "us" and no "others".
It was a time of turmoil - that's all we know.
"For which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esma dared to say, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what was done was done.
It was then.
There is nothing more to be said - here we agree.
And as no one should be blamed, no one should be justified, if it were appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not to learn,
The past exists so that we forget it.
If I can add one word to this -
The Pyramid of Luther Rabinovich collapsed.
"I'll look into your report," he said, releasing it.
The next day, on her way to work, she was killed by a motorcyclist who went out onto the sidewalk, as described by passers-by, "in malicious anger".
Conflicts occur.
Lesotho army says the coup was not planned; prime minister remains in South Africa
Representatives of the Lesotho army denied the fact that a coup was being prepared to overthrow the government, stating that they were acting against the police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the country's army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, declaring that he had been threatened with suicide.
The army's representative, Major Nelle Ntoy, stated that there was in fact no coup, but that the army responded to the threat from "political fanatics" whom the police tried to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces took action, having received several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces who are really planning to armed some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to create chaos," he told the Voice of America.
A representative of the South African government, Clayson Monella, stated that the army's actions looked like a coup.
"While no one has claimed the seizure of power by force, according to all information, the actions of Lesotho's armed forces at the moment have major signs of a coup," he said.
Army representatives in Lesotho reported that the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mottejoa Metsing manages the government in the absence of Taban.
Tabane stated that he believed he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements within his coalition government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations of the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on loan in Milan, Milan Channel reports.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the next hours for a medical examination.
In the previous season, he played for the club only three times.
Recall that previously Milan rented to Liverpool striker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at the lowest level in 13 months
Production growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest indicator for 13 months in August, according to a popular survey.
The latest Markit value of the eurozone industrial sector’s business activity index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed, and the enterprises suffered amid growing tensions between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The figures came before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will expect a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with the eurozone’s breakdown recovery, as well as the risk of deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
It is speculated that ECB head Mario Draghi may give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to that used by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"While some growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior Markit economist.
PMI of the German manufacturing sector, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest for 11 months mark of 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does Italy’s weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
The signs that the growth momentum has declined mainly in the industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also does not add confidence," Mr. Dobson said.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to fuel further speculation by analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news came from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August survey of the eurozone industry activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: "Eurozone producers obviously find life very difficult at the moment, as the current rising geopolitical tension - especially related to Russia/Ukraine - adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit business – and especially consumer confidence – and is likely to lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that "it seems increasingly likely that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some kind of quantitative easing, although we suspect it will be limited."
The residents of Mariupol will exhibit a lively chain against the militia
In Mariupol until last week everything was calm - no one dared to organize Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now the inhabitants await with horror the arrival of the "soldiers".
According to political scientists, the separatists break into Mariupol to go to the Azov Sea - recently the city of Novoazovsk was taken, which was not previously part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupolians decided that the Ukrainian army, even if it would protect them, it had a bit of force against the excellently armed representatives of the Donetsk People's Democratic Republic and People's Republic of China, and gathered to help the military.
They build fences, block posts and fortifications.
In the evening on Saturday several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a live chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and bring equipment and products, collect medicines, publish newspapers.
The city gradually closes shops, banks and ATMs stop working.
Ten Years of Hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the horrific takeover of the school as the children who found themselves in it still suffer
Ten years ago more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, in southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial that shocked the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who deceived death during the school atrocities
Approximately ten years after the horrific seizure of a school in Milan, in which 334 people, including 186 children, died, the heroic survivors of the disaster warned yesterday evening of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamist fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed something like the worst possible evil.
The tragedy united the East and the West in a reversal, which then miraculously turned into action and hope for the future in conditions of intense heat.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who deceived death during the school atrocities.
We have found amazing young people who have faced adversity, even though memories of the terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now tearing Ukraine apart, in which children like them are dying, will now stop.
The girl who in the photo tries to get back to the shooting gym
She was photographed by the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov when she tried to get back into the shooting sports hall in one suit after the mine exploded.
Aida desperately seeks her mother, Larissa, who is now 40 years old.
There were fears that both of them would die, but in fact they survived.
"The woman told me to run out of my way, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My feet were covered with blood.
I got up and climbed back inside to find my mother.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I may need more operations.
Several bones remained in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't break it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and this fact cannot be changed.
Once a year I always go to this sports hall to remember all those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Zera Gapoyeva, was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and dreamed that we would go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says that the capture remains with her, although memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our misery, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from the UK and everywhere.
When I see a picture of me lying in a school window on the Internet, I think that many people will see it for the first time, will know about our tragedy and will make sure that it doesn’t happen again.
A boy who ran through a bullet hole believing that his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians start school at the age of seven) and he survived three days of captivity, embracing his mother Tamara.
And when he was seven years old, he said, My mother said unto me, If there be an explosion, let me be healed, and hold her by the hand.
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Go away."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the road, grabbed the baby's hand and ran through the chest of the bullet.
His father Vladimir, who had seized his son from outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I could not save her."
In fact, Tamara chose freedom and was in a hospital with leg injuries, thinking in turn that her son had died.
After they had been reunited, she said, "I cried out of joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He fled and took me.
Damir was later brought to London (now News of the World), where he was awarded the Barnardo's Children's Defender by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Sherie.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I would like to be able to stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
However, I can say that in my memory it will fade.
I remember immediately after that I threw out all my toy weapons.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and it is not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to return to that sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those children I played with in the yard, who did not choose.
We never say that they are killed or dead.
We say that they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store where I was allowed to choose anything I wanted, and the ride in the car with the open top.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to such a mountain that he and his friends have lived through.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I would like to be able to stop remembering it
“I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,” said Damir, who last week volunteered at a women’s monastery.
I want to help.
I want to serve in the police someday and hope that I will be admitted to the academic academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence immediately after the capture, there were simply no children who would scream and run around, and this silence continued for many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can support.
She was grateful to Shiri Blair and her Foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I would like to call Sheri and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember how, when Damir wanted to eat wrestling, they called all local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with his water pistol, and they ran away and played with him.
And only a month passed after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I all think that this world hasn't gotten better in the last 10 years.
Now in Ukraine there is war, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They are just the same children as ours.
I think for many people war is a news report they hear when they are bored or when they are busy with something else.
I just know that these people feel the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it is so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not aggressive and not evil at all.
He does not seek revenge, for example, he is not addicted to this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they are very close to six classmates, and they walk into the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the sofa, turning away from us, for hours.
He did not sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw out all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, he is taller than me, cute, smart and healthy.
It is hard for me to believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he had died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around, I saw hell around me when parts of the bodies were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember screaming to him, 'Damir, run, run,' but again I was so sure that he didn't hear me.
But when he heard it, he fled.
This is how life continues for us, unlike so many others.
Georgiy Ilin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photo after the capture was decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: surviving Beslan George Ilin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and George on the right today
On his hidden face was a sign of fear when he was saving himself from death, when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, chief doctor, took him to school on the first day of his studies before taking Vladimir's eldest son to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy remained alone for three days of nightmare," she recalled.
Not alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only George managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is no day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was long ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
It hits the soul: George's photo (left) was one of the most shocking shots of the attack and was immortalized in the sculpture (right)
I remember George so wanted to go to school that day that he said he wanted to take the teacher.
I only learned that he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of the crying George in San Marino.
George does not like to look at this picture, and it is hidden in the book cabinet at our house.
I understand, but I also think that thanks to this photo people from all over the world feel our pain.
George now says, "It is important that this never happens again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they are investigating the crash of Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it was caused by?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, as it happens?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need to spend decades to forget it a little bit.
It has affected my health and I still feel it.
About three or four years I had nightmares because of the capture, but now it was better.
I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That’s why I continue to go to this sports hall before every September 1.
I want to pay tribute to my old friends of childhood.
It is hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I will not forget it, but I do not feel pity for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and entered the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I will study to become a cardiosurgeon.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it will not happen.
Georgy Farniev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a terrorist-murderer
Unbelievable: George Farniev was at the feet of the terrorist-murderer during the capture, but he managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to the bomb at the feet of the terrorist-murderer.
Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says George, who wanted to study as an intelligence officer in the FSB, but could not because of the damage that was caused to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I am older now, and they say that children easily cope with bad events - I have to say that it is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - the following year - was the first and last time I entered this sports hall again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please do not ask me to show you where I was sitting on this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgy Farniev today with an open photo of himself in the hospital after the capture
My pain is great, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As far as the physical condition is concerned, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I walk normally.
However, my health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical statements, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second interest was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I know that I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not what children should know, and of course it is not what they should survive.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
It is worse in my soul when the anniversary is approaching.
I will go and be present at the ceremony that will be held to mark it.
I know that George will not go.
For him it must be even stronger, because he was there, and I am not.
I waited for him at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he has returned to me.
He remains with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It is hard to accept when something so terrible and unfair happens to you.
He is a boy, he loves sports, but can't do them because of his knees.
He has had several operations, he can walk, but can not engage in sports.
I would say that he overcame this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This awful experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and this only exacerbates my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and it is the best gift that God could give me, but my heart is grieved for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who have never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world - wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it turn out that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If it were possible to capture all the insurgents and throw them out - as far as possible.
Alena Tskaya, 10 years old
A child who was moved to a safe place by a sniper
Rescued: Olean Tskayaev is taken to a safe place by a Russian Special Forces fighter (left).
Now she's ten (right), and she doesn't remember the monstrous crime at all
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when a Russian policeman took little Alena out of a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Christine and brother Mahar in the sports hall of the school.
Mahara, who was then three years old, was rescued, but Alina's mother and sister were killed in a deadly battle.
Her father Ruslan has since married again, and they have with his new wife Svetlana a little daughter, whom he called Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alana, who is now ten, remembers nothing about the capture and has grown into a smart and cheerful girl, neighbors say.
"They are a great happy family now, and Alena and Mahara are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, returning from Manchester United to Dortmund Borussia, noted that he is looking forward to when he will be able to return to the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer - a joyful event in the career.
Of course, I am very glad that I will again play for "Borussia", - Bild quotes Gagava's words.
I feel very well.
It's full of positive emotions and I'm looking forward to getting back on the field in the form of "Borussia".
Let's remind, Kagawa moved to "MYu" from "Borussia" in summer 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to secure a place in the English club, having played only 38 matches in the English Championship in two seasons, scoring 6 goals and scoring 8 assists.
A man accused of assaulting a girl at a pedestrian crossing in Fayfa
A 78-year-old man stands before a court on charges of attacking a three-year-old girl at a pedestrian crossing in Fayfa.
Gordon Stewart allegedly killed the girl on a transfer to Pittenville in East Newke.
Prosecutors stated that Mr. Stewart had driven his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and killed the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stewart, 78, of Antwerp, denied his guilt in the Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the Royal Advocate, appointed the date of the trial to January.
Obama, Merkel and Holland won’t get together in Vladivostok
The Duty Free Shop of Vladivostok Airport has posted a sign prohibiting a number of world political leaders from making purchases in this shop.
Do not overwhelm them with spirits, water, and alcohol.
The store administration decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and a few other famous comrades will not be able to get drunk with vodka, kerosene and perfume in their store.
And she hanged a table upon the door.
Earlier Obama received a ban on appearing in an even less accessible to him kind of service establishment - Dietary dining halls of MSU, as reported by the site of institutions of hospitality.
Whether the American president ever dreamed of eating at a dining room in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the bans clearly seem terribly reckless to themselves.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that in the conditions of the embargo Russian farmers should learn new technologies in order to set up the production of the cheeses in demand from the buyers.
The advice was given during the visit of the company "Yugpticeprom" of the company "Agrokomplex".
The head of government also advised restorers to reorient to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the right level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been introduced in Russia since August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is satisfied with the results of the tournament DecaNation.
According to the specialist, the third place - a good result considering the lack of targeted preparation for competitions.
Our athletes acted at their level, - "All sports" of Maslakov's words leads.
Third place - confirmation of our sufficiently high team level.
It is nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It is necessary to bear in mind that we were not prepared for these competitions.
The season is over and we did not commit our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we became the second in this tournament, but this season at us the national team has been updated.
The French, on the contrary, presented a capable team, including 13 champions of Europe.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, as they have publicly declared many times.
But even such a composition of hosts of competitions could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians have acted in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some categories were orderly lower than in the same "Billion League".
The season is over.
Naturally, athletes no longer so important result, especially in competitions of team level.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it came to absurdity, when on 1500 m men were so fascinated with tactical tricks of running, that showed the result below the average level... women's races.
4 tips on how to get better quality underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photographs or video underwater, you have before you a variety of equipment options.
The cheapest option is a waterproof "cleaner", such as Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an extreme camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures on a family holiday with several cameras, all for about $350.
Regardless of which equipment you use, there are a few rules to follow in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery of the camera and other compartments are tightly closed.
Additionally, set your camera to the type of photos or videos you want to shoot.
Some cameras have camera modes or object types that optimize exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before jumping into the water, see how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.
Take a look at our customer guide and ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots - because many of them will not get.
The "baths" have LCDs that will help you to compile images, whereas the "exhn cameras" usually do not.
Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater, and composing the frame will be a random process.
So make a few frames.
Also, if your camera has a serial mode that takes several shots with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly as you dive deeper into the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you film in a pool, river or ocean.
This will also allow you to transfer more colors on the photos; the deeper you go, the less colors you will see.
Swim closer to the shooting objects.
This is a great advice for shooting on land, but it is even more important underwater due to darkened light conditions.
Especially important if you are shooting on an X-ray camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to get closer to the shooting objects if you want to fill the frame.
The bronze prize-winner of the 2012 Olympic Games on free-style wrestling Bill Mahov can switch to Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was reported by the head coach of the national team of Dagestan on free-style wrestling Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not exclude the athlete's participation in the World Cup in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently Bill Makhov is on the collection of the team of "classics", - says "R-Sport" words of Sajid Sajidov.
In general, Bill played in both styles.
At the youth championship of the world in 2005 he became the winner of tournament of wrestlers and the third prize-winner in competitions of Greek-Romans and decided to concentrate on free-style wrestling.
Long talks went that the new stage of his career our heavyweight will carry out in Greco-Roman wrestling.
I will tell more: Makhov can perform already at the World Cup in Tashkent - if he wins the prize.
But the decisive word is always behind the coaching staff headed by Goga Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was such a man whose personality power could shake everything around, even in such a gigantic organization as the National Health Service.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieving patients both from the sufferings of illness and from the pains of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalls, was an M-6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors are obsessed with diagnoses and diseases, those who are undergoing treatment are primarily concerned with something completely different - pain.
Once in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote in May last year.
It was difficult for me to find strength in myself.
While struggling with flu-like symptoms, he discovered that he was annoyed with his wife, Juliet.
"I want everything to happen faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet left for work for a week, Lawson discovered that he was unusually and unexplainedly upset.
There was something wrong.
He asked his colleague to make a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lung shell.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But with mesothelioma differently.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbestos, a fiber-based building material that was once called a "miracle", but which is now known to be deadly dangerous.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that cannot be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked in close contact with it: pipe insulators, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems cause for concern today.
But such calm is wrong.
The United Kingdom, it turns out, is today at the peak of the epidemic of mesothelioma.
There are more people dying of mesothelioma than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of around 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from this disease than from car accidents.
Annual deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we feel its fatal consequences now is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were ultimately banned by law in 1999), the development of mesothelioma usually takes decades.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of the specialties of industrial construction.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, laid in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we shop.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of well-being, profession or age.
The ballot boxes, from fashionable London's department stores to private schools, turned out to be no salvation.
The building of the parliament is covered with asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have become reservoirs of this deadly cancer.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a pipe insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he could come into contact with an asbestosist.
Then he conceived.
"It seems there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at the Haitian hospital where I spent six years in internship," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and cargomen - used these tunnels.
Interestingly, how many of my peers are suffering from the same disease?
This was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who trained at the Gaia Hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I remained alive."
How many of us get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
It is unusual to live so long.
Fifty percent of patients with mesothelioma die within 8 months of diagnosis.
She is always deadly.
So now we can only repeat the question of Lawson: "How many of us get the same disease?"
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in the UK, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestosis epidemic in the UK is to survive, about 9,000 people will die.
Most people now do not imagine that they will die in this way.

A quick view of reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma attack has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that they had unwittingly contacted Jenis Ellen with an asbestosist.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing the clothing departments at two facilities, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Ms. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over 20 years of age.
"Before it happened," she says, "I never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew of asbestos.
I could not imagine that it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
They got their name from the word "asbestosform", which means a fiber structure that informs them of strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
The chrysotile, widely known as white asbestos, is more commonly found in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, heating hoses, even in brake valves of cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of health damage" that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
The UK was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there are eternal, albeit indirect, grounds to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK]".

Janis Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients which suggests that "a substantial percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment".
Much of this influence, he says, is due to "the usual use and influence of the weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure that he is safe.
The report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even at the very centre of government, could be affected unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committees were infected with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be moved by something as harmless as "strong air flows".
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case the opposite seems to be true.
Although Parliament's Maintenance Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace received a "clean sanitary certificate," it now acknowledged that £1 billion needed to be spent on rebuilding the Parliament, improving electricity and removing the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, members of Parliament would probably sit in the nearby QE2 conference centre, not on the green rooftops of Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that "the situation with the asbestos was not managed according to different rules".
It is not possible to know whether this control error will cost a lifetime.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who has never been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that successfully filed claims for asbestos," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all places where he worked and dates.
What he clearly remembers is the day in early December 2009 when he was hit by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I began to get sick.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
Being a doctor, Abbott knew that pain came from the plexus, the shell around the lungs.
However, like Janis Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Eventually, he could not go to work for a month.
The doctors performed X-rays of the breast cell and placed pleural catheters to extract fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.
However, his condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he was engaged in sports and breathed heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to his clinic with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was dozens of years older and worked with the asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his consultant showed his results of CT and X-rays to a group of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted between his breast cell and his light body.
I am optimistic.
I usually just go further," he says.
I was not too worried about it, frankly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Subsequently, Abbott entered a meeting with Macmillan's nurses, one of whom suggested that he contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"Asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos heat insulation on pipes was quite common," he says.
People who were affected by asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people in non-typical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-isolated pipes in hospitals were located in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be affected.
But many employees who walked down pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, life was saved for the citizens, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
The pupils installed their burners of Buenos Aires on asbestos stands
And it’s not just hospitals.
Asbestos is often used in offices, shops, libraries and municipalities due to its surprising insulation and fire resistance.
Schools too.
In fact, many were probably the first to be affected by asbestos in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
There are websites that address the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our houses, such harmless things as floor tiles or sarai roofs usually contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison that's embedded in a huge number of our buildings," says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Gay Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the removal of a garden rose in the 1970s.
Therefore, be careful to cut down garden saws.
The effect of diagnosis when it is known that the disease is incurable is enormous.
"It takes quite a long time to realize this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I spent two weeks in surgery.
Then I realized that I would have to go away and deal with myself.
Well, I won’t meet Christmas anymore
One of the most difficult things was moving from a doctor's position to a patient's position.
Like an infinite number of patients before him, he remembers how he was overwhelmed with the amount of information that had to be received.
"It was difficult to realize everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas anymore.
That's all."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we sustain life - the breathing act itself - that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
The asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos is destroyed and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the neck, the shell of the lungs.
Asbestos hair irritates the pleurous tissue and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises because of the inhalation of asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to the Gaia Hospital in 2001.
It was the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he had been exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
The coach knew Lawson and treated some of the others who were likely to have been affected while training at the hospital.
When the asbestos spots fall into the lung tissue, says the Trainer, "the breath pulls them to the periphery where the envelope is.
This is, in essence, an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, is highly controversial.
Some people think it's worth trying.
The trainer does not agree.
"It's impossible to cut a cloth," he says.
It is impossible to approach it with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer "is not very well subjected to chemotherapy", which "acts", but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are sick people who live a long time," says the trainer.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
The writer Stephen Jay Good died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he fell ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after diagnosis, became a support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Allo, Cancer Central," he said cheerfully when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he is still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life for just one month.
"I was in despair," he says.
I wanted to surrender.
Lewison, however, "hosted to give the whole thing a somewhat more positive look".
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loik Lange-Lazdongsky, Professor of Toracular Surgery at Gaia Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need directions, I just called them and they accepted me," Graham admits.
The average patient would have to receive direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best of the available treatments.
However, when such treatments finally inevitably become ineffective, many patients face yet another financial cause for concern – the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they appeal to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to health since 1898," Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small numbers could put health at risk.
It was at this time that the company's dishonesty was discussed.
Andrew Lawson and Gaia Hospital eventually settled the case, but this was not a "complete settlement", according to Morgan, as Lawson was unable to conclusively prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with an asbestos patient at Gaia Hospital.
After an investigation into his death, the hospital's representative confirmed, nevertheless, that "the asbestos in the underground rooms we were talking about was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, linking fatal contact with asbestos to one company or workplace – usually decades later – has proved to be a big problem for patients with mesothelioma requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed ownership or closed.
The insurance records may have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that on their side is time, which the plaintiffs, of course, do not have.
In response, this year, serious new legislative acts came out that make it easier for patients with mesothelioma to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under this law, a £350 million fund has been created, funded by the insurance industry, for those who have been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but who have no one to judge.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary case of compensation - about £120000.
About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that £350 million represents a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal written by the insurers for the insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of what the insurers would have to pay if there had not been a temporary interruption and patients with mesothelioma could have followed the company and filed a lawsuit in the ordinary way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly the Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was “inadequate.”
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that, with seven people dying every day, rapid action was needed.
"People are suffering so much, and they need help today," Penning said during the second reading of Bill on mesothelioma last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loik Lange-Lazdongsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdongsky recommended a surgical procedure, which, unlike Tom Tscher, he believed to be effective.
This was followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - tritherapy, in which Lang-Lazdongsky can boast of a total of 40 percent of survivors in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
"This is of course one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is some power that supports you.
When you surrender, the condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The subsequent scans did not show any signs of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were some spots in my breast cell.
I was supposed to be fifty.
This is not a life threat.
This is the end of life.
And again Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there is no trace of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
It is possible to think about practical things - about finances, when I die, for example, or about what to show to my wife, how the timer works on the fighter.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
We need to look ahead.
Like Eli's father, 16 years old, and Tamzin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It was difficult to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I would not live to old age.
They reacted very differently.
Tamin is very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimmer of possibility of survival.
This disease brings with it (also as, ultimately, for Steven Jay Guld) a dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "the mesothelioma is not a life threat.
The bodies of the anointed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen the pots and increase the heat resistance.

The modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are being opened in Canada and South Africa and soon thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal heat insulator for steam engines and Industrial Revolution turbines.
The world production of asbestos grows more than 30,000 tons per year.
Statistics from Prudential reveal premature mortality among those who work with an asbestos practitioner and who are therefore denied life insurance.

During the Second World War, shipbuilding developed intensely, one of the most deadly professions from the point of view of contact with asbestos.
Voluntary industrial ban on imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for harm to health caused by contact with an asbestos patient in the United Kingdom.
The world production of asbestos grows to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139,000 tons.
The UK's Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety requires all contractors working with the asbestos to be licensed.
Import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the United Kingdom.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the United Kingdom.
The Mezoterium Act was adopted in the United Kingdom.
A compensation scheme of £350 million was announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
World production is around 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose its leaders; protesters pledge revenge
The Chinese parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to trigger long-awaited protests in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People’s Assembly basically allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't deceive our expectations, but it still leads to anger," said legislator Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And it is obvious that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Protecting China's decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Assembly, said it would be too "chaotic" to allow Hong Kong's leader to be nominated for the general election.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom transferred control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to vote for the head of government from 2017 onwards.
Chinese leaders have presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a nomination commission heavily controlled by Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision was taken after the summer, when one of the largest and widely publicized protests in Hong Kong for many years occurred.
Much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong lies behind the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong’s financial district unless Beijing guarantees genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, several hours after the statement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement is moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they will rise to the protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently seeking to avoid problems with state bodies.
In an online application, the organizers reported that the movement "considered the possibility of seizing the central district only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be undertaken if all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are very sorry to announce that to date all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the capture of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
Government authorities in Hong Kong had been preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and on Sunday security measures were reinforced at the government headquarters with police and barricades in place.
At the root of the riots lies the feeling that many in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of their own city.
The arrival of inhabitants from the mainland increases competition in the sphere of goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, will begin to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations put at risk Hong Kong's vital business.
"The protest they are talking about can cause great economic damage depending on how many people will participate and for how long," said legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong is out of control to spread.
This is an idea that is harmful to investment.
Chinese state media also reported in recent days that Hong Kong democracy activists were shown to be Western-led divergents.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants – more than one fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
And in July tens of thousands went out for one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The American culture of graduation balls goes back to university life: first-year students were offered to arrive on a private plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the first UK luxury travel service for current students.
To leave a bright impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options such as a personal aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their things across the country in a dangerously overcrowded car.
In conjunction with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping students this year get to the university with the minimum of effort and the maximum of luxury.
The company's representative said that since this service has just been launched, orders have not yet been received, but added that "students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks".
The company also stated that despite the need for students to pay £9000 a year for their education, it hopes to find a market for this service.
Today's students are quite different from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: it is more important than ever to make an excellent first impression, and VIF is exactly what you need to do that.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as being disconnected from reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS Vice President for Higher Education, said: "This project is incredibly alienated from the lives of most students.
Many students who begin university studies this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to cope with rapidly rising spending on basic needs before they can even start thinking about spending thousands of pounds on something like a simple boarding pass.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri earlier this month.
Those who came up raised their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they waited in line for the funeral.
Following two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri in connection with the murder of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, blogger Miriam Zoila Pérez noticed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments placed gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions grew in the Middle West and attracted national attention, Peres saw responses from white women who focused 100% on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the 9 August assassination, personal essays with headlines such as "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" and "Feminism from a white woman's point of view" appeared relatively late.
But for Peres they demonstrated a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis we are facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so bound up with racial affiliation, they felt that it should be pointed out.
For an English professor at the University of Ohio, Corita, Mitchell Ferguson explored the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as "female problems" in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I'll get 150 likes everywhere," Mitchell says.
When I write something about how coloured people are being attacked in their own country, silence rings.
"Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public sphere?" she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied issues of race, gender, and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine racial and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Andrew Hattery, a professor of female and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the reason for this was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
A white woman was needed to confirm the story to justify the lynching.
From Hetter's point of view, the split between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes such as Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for electoral rights would only be effective for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in the basket for women's right to vote, and the right to vote for blacks should have appeared later," said Hattery.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear idea of why colorful women do not trust white women.
We did nothing good.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching in the Association of Women of the South for the Prevention of lynching.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell’s point of view, the rise in responses by white feminists to the problems raised by Ferguson’s situation – police behaviour, racial discrimination – reflects a time when white feminists had to “catch” the problems that black women have faced over several generations.
"In fact, it would be great if activists who have such a [traditional feminist] ideology were as serious about the right to raise a child as they are about the right to contraception," Mitchell asked.
Second-wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what this means.
Two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, Gloria Steinem, a prominent white feminist activist, used Facebook to publish a sharp article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll calling for white Americans to participate more in racism protests.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the dangers involved in the body - and views on racial issues that differ significantly in public opinion polls - will be at the forefront of change," Steinem wrote.
While Steinem advocates more cross-sectional feminism, which includes both racial and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
Researcher at the American Entrepreneurship Institute Kristina Sommers, author of "Who Stole Feministism?", told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young people of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Stein's remarks about Ferguson contradict the criticism she had previously made.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, “Save My Brother” to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking boys, there was angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem promoting the front-line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, immigration reform has come to light again – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to address this issue as important to women, she simply needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the overwhelming majority of workers’ visas are issued [for male immigrants], the women who come with them find themselves vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a response from women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich house "with pig" for sale
A photograph of a house for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out to be a large pig resting in the living room.
For sale for £120000, a separate one-bedroom house is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was different from the photo of the living room - on which was depicted a pig with a head lying on a sofa.
The real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner of the house.
"However, the photo was posted by mistake and has already been removed," said the company representative.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former gathering house as "a unique single bedroom house".
Although the agency removed the photo from its website, it is still preserved in advertising materials.
The sale of the house caused interest in social networks, where some asked whether the pig was sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the match of the fourth round of the US Open defeated Karolyn Возняцки, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to dignifiedly complete the year and try to reach a new level, passes from New York Vasily ASIpov.
How do you overall evaluate your results at tournaments of "Big helmet" this year?
Of course, I am glad that I managed to win on "Rolan Garros".
As for the other three tournaments, I didn't have enough stability, especially in the ends of some matches.
Now, of course, I am upset.
After all, she could not even reach the quarterfinals.
What challenges do you have before the end of the season?
After a bitter defeat I have a huge motivation to go to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I am going to do everything possible to finish the year worthwhile.
The Asian series of tournaments starts in a couple of weeks.
Member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former World Champion Nikolay Valuyev proposed to give bonuses when entering universities for fulfilling the norms of the GTO.
According to him, standards will generally be the same as in Soviet times - people will give standards on stretching, running and other exercises.
Recall, 12 subjects of Russia will start implementing norms of GTO on their territory from September 1.
I also suggested to students who have given GTO, to give bonuses when entering universities, - Valuyev noted.
For example, it is possible to add a little points to the EEG.
There are also proposals to give an extra weekend to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
In Harvey, South Wales, a new millionaire appeared after winning a lottery
Lottery player from Harvey this month.
A new millionaire is being sought southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will take home nearly $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday evening.
The newspaper kiosk in Harvey brings gold in the main prize for the second time in five years, the previous win amounted to $1 million in November 2009.
However, the successful winner still has to declare himself.
Steve Ford, owner of the store, said the winning caused excitement in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought that such a win could be secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the main prize win last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week the player from Canning Way became one of the five millionaires of August, following a huge $7.5 million win by a pair from Belmont just a few weeks before.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and said that the win gave them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new house.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners of the main prize in Western Australia up to 59 this year, with a total win of $85 million.
Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov told at the round table held by "Vedomosti" at the Moscow Auto Salon - 2014.
The plan was drawn up on the instructions of the government, one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September - early October, says Pulzhnikov, the proposed measures concern electric vehicles and hybrids - the plan for the development of vehicles on gasoline fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (copy available at "Vedomosti") is planned for 2014-2017.
It is necessary to develop criteria for evaluating electric and hybrid transport and to decide how to stimulate the use and production of clean vehicles.
The report to the government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the scheme of preferential lending and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce car prices, stimulate localization and create service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to amend regulatory acts to facilitate conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, petrol stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate within 2015 proposals for regional authorities to also encourage the use of clean transportation – in the form of providing it with advantages in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 – and proposals to expand public procurement of such transportation.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will add criteria reflecting the effectiveness of supporting the production of clean transport and development of charging infrastructure to the list of indicators for the evaluation of the activities of regional authorities.
The electric car market in Russia is only being formed - in 2013 around 100 electric cars were sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import duty on electric cars has been imposed, so sales will amount to about 500 units, Mitsubishi Motors CEO in Russia Andrey Pankov predicts.
But the five-fold growth does not make electric cars any noticeable: in 2013, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold in Russia.
For the time being, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start imports - the company focuses primarily on corporate customers, says Renault Director for Strategic Planning and Partnerships in Russia Nicolas Remis.
The majority of other electric transport manufacturers have taken a forward-looking stance towards Russia.
The development of electric cars is also at the Russian manufacturers - ", GAZ, "", but the production is negligible.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to ASM Holding, AutoVAZ produced 30 electric cars.
The demand is low due to the cost of electric cars, admits the director of "AvtoVAZ" for engineering Sergey Amanov, without state support there will be no breakthrough in this segment....
The development of the Russian electric car market in addition to the cost of cars (the electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average twice as expensive as the analogues with internal combustion engines) is holding back the development of charging infrastructure (fuel - units), says Sergey Tzelikov, CEO of Autostata.
Due to the high cost and low rates of lowering the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years will remain the bottom segment of the Russian market, forecasts the editor-in-chief of "Avtorevyu" Mikhail Porodhansky, Celikov agrees with him.
Car manufacturers, on the contrary, say that some models of electric cars are already close to the normal cost.
The Russian electric car market has good prospects, the main thing is to build confidence in consumers that "electric mobility" is real; this, in particular, will be promoted by the emergence of all new charging stations, stresses the president of the BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state company Rosnets: several stations have been built in Moscow, and soon there will be about 80 more.
Negotiations on the construction of the gasoline network are also conducted with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofia, director of Rosnety department, the company believes in the electric car market and is ready to build filling stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and the absence of a single standard for charging electric cars of different brands.
In addition, Rosnet as a network company does not have the right to sell electricity, the possibility to do this in relation to charging electric cars is being studied.
Pankov believes that the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric vehicle market in Russia is the imposition of customs duties.
The zero rate will be in effect until the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it and expanding the preferential list is being studied.
Replacing the transport tax with environmental (the idea is discussed and concerns all cars) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transportation tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the tax reduction led to a sharp increase in sales of electric cars - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia there are also incentive measures for car owners, such as free parking in the city center (as already done in Moscow), Pankov believes, or the possibility of moving electric cars on defined lanes, which in Russia does not yet exist.
A private plane crashed in Colorado
A single-engine Piper PA-46 crashed in Colorado, United States.
Three of the five people in it were killed, ITAR-TASS reports.
The survivors were taken to hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometres from Denver Airport's runway.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In Donetsk region they deal with prisoners of the battalion "Donbass".
Karateev was surrounded by Ilovaisky.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of soldiers were killed by gunfire.
Those who survive say that if they knew what the situation in the south-east of Ukraine really was, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
Karateers from the Donbass battalion remained alive after the "meat cutter" in which they fell under Ilovaysk.
Surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, the fighters spent several days, effectively abandoned by their commanders and Ukrainian authorities.
When it was reported from the headquarters that the column could be reached via the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But literally a couple of minutes later, rockets and bullets were dropped from all sides.
"According to the information given to me, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," says the deputy commander of the battalion, named "Lermontov".
And when we descended to the bottom between Multiple Pole and Red Moselle, cross-fire began with anti-tank-controlled missiles, with "suckles", 30-millimeter grenades, automatic BMD guns, firearms.
There were four cars ahead of me and three behind me, so there were only two cars left.
The officer with the name "Lermontov" tells: almost immediately at least 60 people died, dozens were wounded, many died later.
The survivors now receive medical assistance from those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give food, medicines.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and led them to true death.
We were simply betrayed, - they say.
Colonel, the whole battalion, to destroy it.
In the battalion "Donbass", like many of his comrades, Alexey entered as a volunteer, after all in Ukrainian news told about the atrocities that allegedly committed in the south-east "separatists".
Already here Alexey saw a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Lugansk - not by anyone, but by Ukrainian soldiers.
A friend called me, told me that there was a mortar fire, that it was probably Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Alexey.
After that I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not released from Ilovaysk, they said that we were in a ring.
I have already agreed with the commander, the report has already written about leaving.
From the collections with Zurahovo we were immediately lucky to Ilovaysk.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were stranded in a "cott" under Ilovayskoy.
Now some survivors admit that if it was possible to turn back time, they would not have entered the combat battalion for anything.
All the prisoners were handed over to the rebels.
Everyone is checked for involvement in military crimes.

Together they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the region.
News Economics — Will Kiev compensate Rosneft for $140 million losses?
Head of Rosneft Igor Sechin stated that the company estimates the damage from the shooting of the Lischansky refinery in Ukraine at $140 million.
He reported this in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government for compensation," said Sechin.
According to him, the modernized Lissachinsky Refinery was scheduled to be put into operation in 2014.
However, part of the factory was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fights, there were no 'buried insurgents', but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, the technological oil that has been pumped into the pipes has been lost,” he said.
Recall, on July 18 in connection with the shooting of Lischansky refinery the oil storage tank burned and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
Lischansky Refinery is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the enterprise was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichan refinery is about 7 million tons of oil raw material per year.
The plant is capable of producing Euro-4 fuel as well as Euro-5 diesel.
In March 2012, oil supplies to Lischansky refinery were suspended due to its deficiency.
It was decided to start repairs at the plant.
A year later, Rosneft acquired Lischansky Refinery together with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BP.

It continued to fall and the ruble and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Now investors are already anticipating the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
But until now, it is more like artificial hysteria spread through the media, especially Western ones.
There are not many candidates for new sanctions against the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange the ruble continues to weaken sharply against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both the Russian indices and the position of the national currency can be adjusted.
"Orenburg Airlines" will compete with "Ideal-tour"
"Orenburg Airlines" filed "Ideal-tour" claims for a total amount of 4.7 billion rubles.
These are two cases that will be discussed in October.
The cases will be examined by different judges.

General Director of Aeroflot Vitaly Savelev calls an even bigger sum - two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to become more interesting for new users
Twitter's microblogging service has changed the process of registering users to involve new participants more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who dropped their microbiologists.
Now new Twitter users will be able to view a large number of accounts recommended by the service during registration to immediately build up their reading circle.
Recommendations are made on the basis indicated when registering interests.
At the same time, Twitter automatically sets a subscription tab for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to remove the tabs manually, so that they do not read those who are not interested in them.
If before users of the microblogging service saw only avatars of recommended users, now Twitter draws a sample of one of the popular tweets of a blogger to help make an impression about a person.
This is the biggest change in the Twitter registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter is actively working on the modernization of the service.
This activity is primarily linked to the continuing efforts of the service to achieve infallibility.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a decline in reader activity.
At the moment, the company desperately needs more loyal customer resources, who, once entering, would stay long.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.

Car Recycling Program resumed on September 1
Since September 1 in Russia the program of car recycling is renewed.
By 31 December 2014 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov explained, the money is allocated from the limits, which have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other directions of support.
The program covers all cars over the age of six years.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a car to 350 thousand rubles for a cargo.
Earlier in Russia, a similar program of vehicle disposal was already in place.
The main difference of the current project, the Minister explained, is that now it is not only the disposal of cars for obtaining a subsequent discount, but also the possibility, if the car has reached the age of more than six years, to purchase a new one with a discount when the old one is handed over to the dealer in "trade-in", Interfax reports.
The previous federal recycling program, which ran from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011, lost over 16 billion rubles.
Thanks to it, the level of production of cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nicky Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game about contemporary journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Keys began work on the game a few weeks ago, but the fact became widely known only now.
The game was inspired by events in Ferguson, where protests are taking place after a policeman killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be on how informational coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes between police and the population take place.
The hero can photograph what is happening in different ways, which will influence the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the policemen look like heroes and the protesters are bandits, the police will treat him better and let him go where no ordinary person can go.
If he covers events differently, his photos can turn peaceful protests into massive riots.
Points in the game will have to be collected with the help of the hero Twitter, in which new subscribers will appear if the photos posted there will become popular.
The game has no title yet.
The date of release and the platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Keys, however, published an image showing how the event can change depending on how a photograph of it is taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to devote it to events in the Gaza Strip, not to protests in the United States.
After he began collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media covering events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what happened.
Nicky Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about events from Case's own biography, is devoted to how a bisexual teenager tries to tell about his relationship with gay parents.
Helicopter pulls Ukraine into continuing bloodshed
With the call to prepare for the next "tens of thousands" victims Minister of Defense of Ukraine Valery Geletai draws the people to continue the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a message.
"In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valery Geletyev, who declared "the completion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists" and the beginning of "The Great Patriotic War", in which losses will be calculated "tens of thousands".
The degree of adequacy of the head of the Ukrainian military department, who published the mentioned post on his Facebook page, is a subject for research of specialists not in the military field," the message of Russian diplomats reads.
They hardly believe that such statements can belong to the Minister of Defense of a civilized state.
On his Facebook page the Ukrainian Defense Minister wrote on Monday: "On unofficial channels the Russian side has already several times threatened that in case of continued resistance they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
At the same time, he declared that "Operation for the liberation of Eastern Ukraine" was completed.
Perez Hilton removed all intimate photos of the stars and apologized
Today, the horror has covered more than 60 stars of Hollywood.
Hackers breached primitive passwords in the iCloud (data storage) in smartphones, after which their intimate images appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
For a while.
Recall, the official representative of the star of "Voice Games" Jennifer Lawrence has already informed about the theft of photos from her mobile phone, and also confirmed that all the images that " shine" in the Network are authentic.
Perez Hilton - creator of the same-name blog site, has apologised to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues in the chain for publishing their frank pictures, writes The Independent.
No, nobody forced me to do this.
Their agents did not contact me.
And now I will remove the frank photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justine", - wrote the blogger on Twitter.
However, all the revealed photos of the stars have already spread through the network.

This occurred in Los Angeles at a turn on Boulevard Sanset.
He was a British footballer who developed a knee and extended the muscles of his right hand.
Beckham left the tattoo salon, where he was greeted by the paparazzi.

Tony Stewart suffers an accident when returning to the track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended a little more than halfway through the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front tire broke off in 172 laps, putting an end to his performance.
Stewart brought his broken car to the garage and then left without talking to the reporters.
Chairman of his team Chad Johnston said that 14 members of the team were upset, but will now focus on the race for the next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I would like to have a more successful attempt and a more successful finish for him," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully we'll do better there.
Stewart first crashed into a wall earlier in the race Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required repairs to the right side of his car.
"I started today with quite a lot of hope to come to the finish successfully," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded onto an evacuator, and the crew gathered and was ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car crashed and killed another driver during a ground race in northern New York.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either in Atlanta or the next races in Richmond to take part in the Pursuit.
He returned to work during the investigation of a tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went out to express his dissatisfaction with Stewart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities said on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least another two weeks.
The decision on whether Stewart would be charged was not taken.
The three-time champion was met with loud applause and applause when he was represented before the race.
Starting from the 12th position, Stewart was in the first 10 at the start of the race, reaching the fourth position.
Then on the 122th round after the restart the Bush number.
The car 18 fell off the track at the exit of turn 2 and crashed into Stewart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell to 21st place.
Sobchak and Vitorgan breakfast with Zvonetsky in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, about which the TV presenter did not turn to report in her Instagram.
However, one photo very surprised and very confused the fans of the couple.
The film was shot by Zvonetsky.
"At breakfast at Mikhail Mikhail Zhvanetsky Maxim explains what is an Instagram :)) #odess," - signed the photo of Ksenia Sobchak.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, biscuits, oil or anything else...
The couple's devotees decided that Kshusha also smokes, and condemned her for it.
"And whose cigarettes?, "smoking kills!", "Some kind of cigarette breakfast) ", "It would be on breakfast, and on the table only cigarettes))) ", "Ksenia, you also smoke?", - excited for her favorite subscribers of her blog.
Recall, recently Sobchak was proud of what delicious dinner Maxim Vitorgan prepared for her for the first time in her life.
The main thing is that at the end of the dinner he did not say words from the anecdote: "that now it would be like this every day," - Ksenia Sobchak boasted of her husband.
The picture shows that Maxim is preparing something with diligence, and on the table are already lambs and baked chicken.
Bulgarian prisoners held a national protest
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria held a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands to restore the previous working conditions, which have recently been changed.
The salary increase is also included in the list of requirements, which will be discussed with the acting Minister of Justice Christo Ivanov.
During the month, officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the prison workers’ union met several times with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
The negotiations are continuing, the head of the Headquarters for the execution of penalties Rosen Zhelezkov said.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Trade Unions of employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs will join the protest of the prison workers' union.
The Army Controls Thailand’s New Government
General Prayut (right) appointed the Minister of Defence of the Republic of Yugoslavia, Mr. Yorit Wangsuan (left)
Thailand's military governor and prime minister, General Prayut Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of the country's new cabinet, in which more than a third of the posts are held by generals or retired generals.
Representatives of the army received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Prayut Chan-Ocha was officially confirmed as Prime Minister following the King of Thailand's official approval of the appointment of the Chief of the Temporary Military Government to the post.
The 60-year-old soldier who took power in the country as a result of the May 22 bloody coup was the only candidate for the prime minister's post.
He was elected Prime Minister at a parliamentary session.
Earlier the army appointed deputies of parliament.
According to Prayuta Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat's government.
Officially, Prayut Chan-Ocha will be the provisional prime minister, as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military are trying to strengthen their power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22
against the backdrop of a complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yiinglyk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is rooted in 2006, when the army removed Prime Minister's brother Yiinglyk Chinawat Taksin.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has ensured them success in elections many times.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital elite joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralysed the country since November 2013.
No one has said that in the midi will be better, I didn't promise you that, a waiter from the new bracelet Palm pulls out.
It is formally recognized that this is indeed the case, but the mind and the stomach remain steadfast.
After all, everyone knows for a long time: we say "Belgium" - we mean "middies", we say "middies" - we mean "Belgium".
The restorers like to say that the success of the establishment depends on three factors: location, location and again location.
There are places that are not so good, but even excellent, but some unfortunate.
In short, sitting at Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe "Gorodok" (in honor of the same TV show), then "Odessa-mama", and also a restaurant "Godole" and a beer "Druba".
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Above the ground was only the top of the iceberg: a bar and a couple of tables, all the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But here it is fun, as in a children's room: red, yellow and green walls, multi-coloured chairs, instead of windows - TVs, where girls-dressers swim.
The Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg are no longer new, so there is something to compare.
There are eight kinds of distilled beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 l) and countless bottled beer (170-1550 rubles).
Companies-positive waiter entertainingly presents the menu, telling that "foods are full of big seeds", and it should be noted: it is the service, despite some shortcomings, - the most positive aspect of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Well, who, for example, is given to warn that a meat roulette with a Welsh black-and-white (280 rubles) - in fact carpaccio, cut also so thin that parchment paper in comparison with it will appear to be a disfiguringly thick material.
It is possible to taste any flavor, only if you aggress the plates together.
The situation with salads is even worse.
The classical legacy (260) would be the most correct to recognise as a crime against the Belgian people: some tasty iceberg, an old-fashioned cardboard baked, a thickening Kenyan salad, odorless bean chips plus a marinated onion.
You don't want to meet anyone with such a salad!
The ingredients of the Belgian salad were partly different, but the impression was not positive either.
If you could still close your eyes to the immature quarters of tomatoes, blacks or roasted champagnes, then why do the tomatoes look as if they had been defrosted and boiled several times in their lifetime!
After all, I already know: there are quite normal white-water myths here!
They are served in saucers of your choice (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
The sauce of half an inch, the one made of white wine, celery and carrot, frankly did not get stuck.
Vegetables are there, but the fragrance is not there, and whether or not there was wine remains a mystery.
However, good-looking midia fries with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken with ketchup here - not bread, thick to such a degree that depending on the mood you can decide, the first or second dish before you, but just a pleasant creamy soup.
It was stated that the rabbit was cooked by a local cook in beer sauce, and nothing was said about the rosemary.
On the other hand, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposed: the rosemary was overwhelmed by everything.
It appeared that this rabbit was fed exclusively rosemary crusts during its lifetime, which is why the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time the rabbit's knife was attached to a wonderful - no, just cancelled broccoli in caramelized rabbit.
The waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also nutritious - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The clay sauce turned out to be too watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table was very informally interested in the dining experience.
Therefore, it is worth coming again.
The exchange rate of the dollar rose on the MМВB above 37 rubles on news about the preparations by the West of new sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar by "morning" settlements at 10:29 msk rose by 26.9 kunas and was 37.02 roubles, the exchange rate of the euro rose by 30 kunas - up to 48.73 roubles, according to the data of the Moscow Exchange.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 копеек to the level of the previous closing and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the events in Crimea, the dollar reached its peak on February 19, 2009 - at that time it cost 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014, it was already 37.005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are discussing the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble has a long-term character, both in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, - says senior analyst of "Alpari" Anna Bodrova.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today the rumours about the invasion of troops have not been confirmed by any party, but the market has proved very emotional.
All the talks that he was resilient to such news yesterday were overwritten.
The week, according to the specialist's forecasts, will close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all linked to one chain.
Inflation growth is also forecast: the current prices for the autumn will increase from 5 to 10%.
Soon, moreover, seasonal vegetables and fruits will be finished, and a vacuum will arise as the networks reorient to other suppliers.
"The dollar approached the mark in 37 rubles, passed it and returned back, there is no strong hysteria, - commented the head of the market analysis department "Opening Broker" Konstantin Bushov.
They will still be watching whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, how NATO will settle.
The ruble, according to him, weakened sharply after the end of the tax season, then there was news about Ukraine, moreover, the Central Bank last week stated that until the end of the year completely moves to a floating rate and refuses any currency interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was no different from the previous ones during this month, all was scared by the mark in 37 rubles, - continues the analyst.
And so, in terms of turnover nothing powerful happened.
The troubled times for the currency market were, I remember, when there was an increased demand for currency at the end of January, and also on March 3, when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, it is an increase in the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the increase in imports, says UFS IC chief analyst Alexey Kozlov.
Negative points can be attributed to the increase in imports of goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investments in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a consequence, become a cause of higher borrowing money, which in turn, hampers the development of the country’s economy.
Speaking of the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble slightly aggravates the decline in share prices expressed in ruble.
For example, the MICEX Index declined by 1.67% on Thursday, while the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
The significant difference in the relative magnitude of the index decline is due to the weakening of the ruble over the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble has an emotional character and is explained by the massive desire to buy the currency.
As practice shows, emotions gradually disappear, and ruble quotes partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," - says Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
Brittany said that she had spent many years thinking she would die after an incorrect diagnosis.
Carolyn Rogers spent much of her teenage years thinking that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Sharco-Mari-Tuta disease (SMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that cause damage to nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
The charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with MS because so little is known about the condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are believed to have MMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, uncertain walking, and stiff toes.
Patients may experience vomiting or pain, and the condition does not heal and progress, which means that symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13 years old, she thought she was suffering from the attack of Frederick (A.F.) - a condition for which the prognosis was very bad.
Rogers thought she would be kneaded to the wheelchair by the time she was 18 and would die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do what the others did.
I was falling every day, and I had more time for everything.
I had never been able to ride rollercoaster or skateboard with other children, and I had to wear a lot of clothes at school because I was walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at the medical card when her doctor came out of the room and there was written that she had AFS.
"I felt guilty because my nose was dry where it shouldn't be, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the Association of AF," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the worst panic possible.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in that period.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He simply got up, hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease, because you would already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that represents a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic tests, she was diagnosed with FMT.
"When he explained what SMT was, I thought I pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
The UK-based charity SMT announced a month of information on SMT to try to raise awareness of the disease.
Tax burden on entrepreneurs of Washington area grows as the economy recovers
The emerging economy means more customers, more sales, and more jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
State and local tax accounts for companies across the country increased moderately last year, as economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia paid $27.6 billion to state and local governments in fiscal 2013, 3.8 percent more than $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
Tax burdens on businesses at both state and local level increased by 4.3 percent last year, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after consecutive years of declining accounts in 2009 and 2010.
Taxes levied by the state increased faster, 4.3 percent, than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by a professional services firm, Ernst & Young, and the State Taxation Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county's tax revenues, 56 percent, are taxed on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of Maryland's tax revenues are taxed on firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the lowest amount of tax revenues, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenues is due to the return to the remaining value of real estate companies, say researchers, that raised real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three years in a row, when the growth was less than 1 percent.
While most of these revenues come from larger states such as California, New York, and Texas, it appears the same is happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 percent compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate does not have any similar effect on the growth of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one fifth of corporate tax accounts.
Companies in Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of their state and local tax bills in real estate taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or a non-profit organization that doesn't pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the state's Taxation Center.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that exist in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs’ incomes also seem to be improving, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion from 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenues, the largest in the region.
Although trends are in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three localities.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the average in the country, 4.3 percent, whereas growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below the average of 4.1 percent.
In Virginia there was the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate), equal to 6 percent.
In Maryland the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, whereas in the county it is relatively high - 9.975 percent.
A similar US Chamber of Commerce study earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower taxes for entrepreneurs at state and local level and, overall, a more favourable tax climate for entrepreneurs than Maryland.
The county was not assessed in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its southern neighbour.
North Carolina recently signed legislation reducing corporate rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, this law could raise the income tax rate for entrepreneurs even to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to feel better and thus pay more taxes on the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Taxes on entrepreneurs paid in the form of an individual income tax by small business owners – the transitional structure under which most small businesses operate – in the Districts of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia increased by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, at a much faster rate than taxes on entrepreneurs in general.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business tax revenues across the country is likely to continue this year, with revenues from turnover taxes in state and local governments rising by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may lag behind, as federal spending cuts affect the labor market in the region.
Bronze Age of Russian judo
The domestic judo world championship brought to the national team of Russia two silver and seven bronze awards.
On this indicator the Russians lost only the main favorite of competitions - the national team of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner became Beslan Mudranov, who acted in the category to 60 kg.
At the same time in the same final wrestling with Boldбаатар Ганбат from Mongolia the outcome of the confrontation decided only one remark, received by the Russian.
And here the second day of tournament became the most successful for the national team of Russia - on Tuesday were won immediately three medals.
In men's competitions in the category to 66 kg silver went to Mikhail Poyalev, and bronze - Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final duel, the Russian lost to the 2011 and 2013 world champion Masashi Ebinome.
Khan-Magomedov, in the quarterfinal stage losing to his compatriot, won the consolation tournament and became the holder of the bronze award.
In the women's tournament of the category to 52 kg also to the third step of the podium of honour arrived Natalia Kuzyutin.
In the semi-final she lost the current world champion Mailind Kelmendi from Kosovo, who at this championship acted under the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully defended the title.
In the dispute for bronze Kuzutina won at Ma Inan from China, but after the end of tournament still admitted that the third place - it is not at all what she expected.
And again the obstacle on the way of the Russian to gold was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutin earlier in the final of the European championship.
On the third day of tournament in Chelyabinsk the bronze in the cup of the national team of Russia put Musa Mogushkov, fighting in category to 73 kg.
In the quarter-finals his opponent became former representative of Moldova Viktor Skovortsov, now playing for the UAE team.
But then the Russian won two fights and became the winner of the award.
Mogyshkov performed at the home championship with the injury of a holenop, which he plans to relieve in the near future, so and will take a break in competitions.
As for the former Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he at this tournament reached the bronze medal.
Interestingly, that another of his compatriots, who accepted sports citizenship of the UAE, Ivan Remarenko with bronze finished the performance in category to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the M-2014 also brought to the Russians one bronze, which in the category to 81 kg won Ivan Nifontov.
In the final he defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmitt.
On Friday at the tournament three sets of awards were played at once, but Russians by tradition were limited to one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Questions, and the national team of Russia this medal was guaranteed: his opponent on the comforting final was his compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the match did not take place: Questionov's opponent was unable to get on the tatami due to an injury.
Men's bronze was won by the owners and on the sixth day of competitions - it was placed in the coupling of the national team by Renat Saidov, who acted in category over 100 kg.
In the final, he won a clear victory over Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended the individual part of world superiority.
On the last day of tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian national teams - both male and female - were one of the main applicants for awards, but, as in individual competitions, representatives of the beautiful sex did not get lucky - to the medal they did not reach.
And here the Russian judoists won the team silver.
In decisive confrontation they in persistent wrestling with the score 2-3 lost to the main favorites of competitions - the team of Japan.
At the same time the national team of Russia led 2-0 after a clean victory of Khan-Magomedov and willful - Denis Yartsev (weight to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals were not able to cope Murat Khachatiyev (81), Mahomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiyev (100).
On the same scenario developed and bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian national team, leading 2-0, lost to the Japanese - 2-3.
At the team competitions in Chelyabinsk was the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, who after the end of tournament congratulated the men's national team with silver.
"The second place - it is very honorable, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could become champions, - said Putin, whose words are quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the natives of judo - there is nothing sinister here.
But I am sure that you can win with them.
The Russian national team at the home world championship performed much better than a year ago at competitions of the same level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
Then in the asset of the Russian team there were only three medals - one silver and two bronze.
At the same time the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isayev.
We are all, of course, great maximalists.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let us remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is in the eighth strongest, then he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Even more in such a form of sports as judo", - summed up the results of tournament the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, the words of which the press service of the championship brings.
Japan's national team was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of different dignity, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held in the summer of next year in Astana.

Joan River's family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from the illness.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopes, sources say.
The doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "heavy".
The response was broad, including numerous online support from such figures as Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Rippa.
All the kings will be able
The debut album of the band Royal Blood - a new hope of British rock, brought rock duo from clubs straight to stadiums is on sale.
The Royal Blood duo has been on stage for a year, but already has an active nomination for the BBC Music Award, a warm-up tour with the Arctic Monkeys, and a visit to a New York gig by Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before its release, and the contract for its release is in the portfolio of Warner Music.
Given the current appalling situation on the music market, the situation is out of the row, after all it is not about a new Lane Del Rey or another sweet voice of the representative of "new R'n'B", but about a duet of British-looking cowboys playing with the same level of volume and intensity that last time was in fashion a couple of decades ago.
Overall, bets on the first album were particularly high due to all the above circumstances and were already well justified.
The Duet had taken for granted a name which had not been claimed by even desperate hairy metalists before, and the blood of which kings seemed to be flowing in their homes was also understandable.
This is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the previous level Led Zeppelin: like the big quartet, Royal Blood set their goal to stir up the blood of British rock, taking it to a new height.
It is perhaps premature to make predictions about the success of this enterprise yet, but something can already be affirmed.
Ten songs laid down in thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of the phenomenal talent of the composer as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of the individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: let's say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by what is remembered not by a melodic line, but by a drum part.
The musicians joke that this song is easier to sing than to drink.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing track "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a party of heavy rock lovers, but when played consecutively they merge into more or less homogeneous painting.
And this is not necessarily bad, even the opposite.
Royal Blood's strength lies in the fact that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartneys (they soon become Motörhead's successors), but have brought numerous rock duo from the ghettos of the indie clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, is created for stadiums, in a space designed for fewer than a couple of thousand people, it is clearly close.
The secret is partly in the cunning use of the bass, replacing the guitar in the usual format, invented at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
However, it is not only about the instruments, but also about the very approach to the composition of songs.
The heroes of the retrorock of the zeroes were chosen with great difficulty outside the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance to recognize themselves not simply as epigons, but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sounds so powerful and aggressive that this effort successfully drags some secondaryness and hardness of the music material.
And finally, who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: The online store - and the video producer, and a hundred other things - buys the streaming video reproduction service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago the sale of Twitch to Google video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and such a combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set out to be a streaming service of a general nature - a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; "YouTube for real-time games," according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", the genre of video clips in which allies give (mostly old) games processing, as in "Mystery Theater", are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of an incumbent technology company buying a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube failed, given that, according to the information, he was willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have at the moment is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shire: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snowballers like me, who claim that they will be better engaged in sports than watching it, it is difficult to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking in the hand of a chess player.
One thing is to watch through a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m. when she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another is to watch as some outsider gets 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games that you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them without controlling the angle of vision on your own can be a recipe for headaches worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the high-speed walks in which Rogers Bannister of our electronic age finish whole games in record time are entertaining.
But if it's not about the virtuosity of the game or humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and is the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon make money on this?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch will turn into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could simply absorb Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would be happy to receive: crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As head of Twitch Shire said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of games", and this channel does not show signs of enthusiasm, even - oh - as a spectacular sport.
The 2004 terrorist attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We spoke with the survivors - almost all now students, with the parents of the deceased, with the guardian of the cemetery - Cities of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the "Mother of Beslan" committee Susanna Dudieva, who took part in the special operation by the MIC employee, - says the correspondent of the "Community" department Elizabeth Antonova, who worked on the special project.
Already returning to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was the President's adviser on the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with the officer of the "B" FSB of Russia Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What particularly shocked me during the work on this topic is that in Beslan it is as if there were not these ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for anyone who has any relation to it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But Beslan cannot be forgotten, and I hope that we managed with our task," Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the infographic studio of the Rambler & Co holding company, which has been working in the company since spring of this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's stay in power.
North Korea launched a small-range missile
North Korea has launched a small-range missile into the waters of the Japanese Sea, reports "Renhap".
It was launched at 10:30 a.m. local time from the province of Chagando, located on the North Korean-China border.
Probably, the rocket fell into the Japanese Sea, flying about 220 km, stated the United Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
Deputies propose to speed up the entry into force of the law on personal data
In case of success of the initiative, Russian data will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015
The State Duma has introduced a draft law that provides for the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on Russians' personal data - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activity of the lower chamber.
Its authors were deputies of the State Duma Vadim Daygin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parakin (Just Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (CPRF).
Such a change, in the opinion of the authors of the initiative, will contribute to more efficient and effective provision of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation on the preservation of personal data and observance of the secret of correspondence in information and telecommunication networks.
The law, whose entry into force is rushed by parliamentarians, obliges to store in the territory of the Russians personal data processed through the Internet.
It also makes mandatory the recording, systematication, accumulation, storage, refinement and extraction of personal data of Russian citizens in databases located in the territory of Russia, as well as the indication of the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right to restrict access to information processed in violation of the Russian legislation in the field of personal data on the basis of a court decision.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of violators sites - an automated information system "Register of violators of the rights of personal data subjects".
This law was adopted by the State Duma in the summer.
The bill was drafted by Andrei Lugova and Vadim Daygin of the PLDP and Alexander Yushchenko of the CPRF.
Daggin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in the Russian Federation will have to pay for rent
Commenting on the bill introduced to the State Duma today, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy Leonid Levin stated that he does not see problems for the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own personal data stores of Russians in the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "to Rostelecom", which repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provides their servers, to Mail Group, to Western companies, which today already provide their servers".
“At the same time, there are several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this area,” he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problems - they will receive technological opportunities for placement," - concluded Levin.
The controversial bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the bill is passed, Russians will no longer be able to use many global internet services.
In particular, it is about the services of online booking of flights and hotels.
According to the association, "the draft law deprives subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data by emphatically determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation".
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be the creation of a mechanism for informing the user where the recording is taking place, and the systematization of his personal data.
In this case, he or she will be able to choose on which territory the above-mentioned actions will be carried out.
The adoption of similar bills on the "localization" of personal data in other countries has led to the abandonment of global services and to significant economic losses.
The participant of the test of the ice water wind blows out the jaw
Isabelle Roberts of Great Britain cried so loudly when ice water was poured on her head that damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test of the ice water wind came to pain not so.
The woman was hospitalized after she shouted so loudly during a test run by ice water that she blew out her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts cried so loudly when ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I cried, but when I did it, my jaw started to shoot," she told The Mirror.
The water is flowing for the 20th year.
Isabel Roberts in a second before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but it didn't, it was stuck, and then I realized that something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came to the same understanding and they began to cry, but I had to be rushed to the emergency department.
A 20-year-old woman from the UK was taken to a hospital to operate on her jaw after participating in a popular engagement Tuesday.
The video became an Internet sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Poles handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
In the "Army of Novorossia" claim that killed Ukrainian Su-27, and accuse the opponent of violating the ceasefire agreement
As of 10 a.m. on 1 September, the rebels handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 soldiers killed.
This was reported to Interfax by the representative of the press service of the Army of Novorossia.
He added that "a Su-27 aircraft violating the ceasefire agreement was shot down by air defense forces in the area of the settlement of Mereshka".
According to the interlocutor of the agency, the Ukrainian side in the artillery bombardment of Lugansk airport applied the ammunition prohibited by international conventions.
The representative of the press service noted that during the night the militants managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force at one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armoured vehicles and two ammunition warehouses.
"Losses in the enemy's livestock - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, 13 people were taken prisoner," - summarized the representative of the headquarters.
Interfax does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday the armed formations of the "national republics" of Donbass declared the transfer of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine to the Ukrainian side within the framework of compliance with the ceasefire regime.
At the same time during the night, the DNR army, according to the "Army of Novorossia", "intercepted the attempt of the National Guards in violation of previously reached agreements to remove heavy equipment from the surrounding area".
At that time, the militias reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total casualties of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupolsk) for that night amounted to five tanks, eight battle armored cars, more than 120 people killed and wounded
At the end of last week a large group of Ukrainian soldiers was surrounded by militias in the Ilovaisk area of Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the "national republics" to release Ukrainian soldiers from the encirclement.
The DRC agreed to do so on the condition that the enemy surrender weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of soldiers began leaving the surrounded settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defense battalion "Donbass" Semenchenko, another 14 people came out of the "catch" on Sunday night.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded are "prisoned at 137 regiment of the 32nd Division of the Russian Federation and 9th Tank Brigade of the Russian Federation", where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defence denied reports by Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Russia will take countermeasures in case of new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take countermeasures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry reports.
The statement of the Russian Foreign Ministry says that the "conclusions" of the European Council of 30 August demonstrated the inability of the EU member states to overcome the inertia of their unwavering support by the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on "absolutely unproven statements about the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of that country", the agency's website said.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening the confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide the conditions for a full "dialogue between the opposing sides", the agency stresses.
Also on the website of the department it is noted that now there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has returned, and the number of victims among the civilian population is increasing.
We remind that within the next seven days in the European Union it is planned to develop concrete proposals on sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives work closely with US officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate between the measures to be taken over the period of action and the degree of severity.
The new EU sanctions could affect the energy and financial sectors.
The Australian government has also announced an expansion of sanctions against Russia in the areas of defense, finance, and the oil and gas industry.
Cheap ways to save on university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schröder, who will soon move to a second course, has devised a tricky way to cut costs.
He developed a system for renting books to seniors, offering them nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"My mathematical analysis textbook, which usually costs $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a "Chick-fil-A" cookie," says Schröder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for the last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1200 a year on textbooks and educational supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online shops and creative ideas such as the Schröder system.
Book rental is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and is often significantly cheaper than their purchase.
Nibo Inc., which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that book sales have doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores during the last spring semester were rented out, says Nibo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the professional association "National Association of University Bookstores".
Here is an introduction to the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Purchase in online shop
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you will see in a university bookshop.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hosteler costs about $290 per preview, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 at Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Purchase of maintenance
If you are not against foreign notices or damage, maintained textbooks are a good option.
Mathematical Analysis is sold for $93.49 on Chegg.com.
Matt Casey, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a kept copy of the textbook "Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding the Business Side of Advertising Business".
The book was sold for $48.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Brycey, director of the "College Without Walls" at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, offers students to ask their professors if they can't use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are not essential for classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small share of the value of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Rental
If you are good enough to deal with the textbooks, do not forget to return them and do not want to leave them to yourself after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student could rent "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you pick up the books, including any penalties that may be imposed on you for marking, highlighting and damage.
If you rent a book, remember: if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of the new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks - another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented by buying an electronic license for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Renting Mathematical Analysis on Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Breisy says that students studying literature often find the most profitable prices, as many classical works can now be downloaded for free, while literature in the natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
Nevertheless, be careful.
Joe Gold, 29 years old, who is going to start studying at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to clarify the price of the book, as it guarantees that you are looking for exactly the text you need.
Before making an online order, says Holt, it is imperative to check whether the book is actually on stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The book he purchased was delayed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin declared the Fund for the Development of the Far East to be completely ineffective
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the state support of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
"15 billion rubles remained on deposits," the President stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State instructed to speed up the approval of the list of territories in the Far East.
He reminded that the draft law necessary for the creation of TRs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, did not approve the list of territories in the Far East and their criteria until July 1.
Vladimir Putin also outlined the main tasks for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, increasing transport accessibility of the region, removing infrastructure restrictions - both on the domestic market and for export development.
Besides, it is necessary to create the conditions for attracting additional investments in the region, as well as to form the territory of the forthcoming development, which should become competitive in relation to the key business centers of the ACP, the President emphasized.
Recall, earlier it was reported that the territory of the outgoing development can replace the EEZ.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy could not save the cash collections
"The Unstoppable 3" by Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from its $90 million U.S. budget, while "City of Sins: A Woman worth Killing" returned only $12 million from its $70 million budget.
"The Big Video" with Cameron Diaz earned only $14.6 million in the first weekends, while children's films such as "How to Attach Dragon 2" also disappoint revenue.
The article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collins points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be about the poor quality of the films themselves.
Collins called 2014 the "worst" year ever in terms of children's films, and called "How to Attach Dragon 2" a barely "functioning" fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film released in the summer with at least 2,000 copies between Memorial Day in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both film viewers and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is similar in calibre to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that this may be due to changing viewing habits and growing popularity of streaming Internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on the soon-to-be released Disney film The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing."
We must recognise this and not try to pursue what was before.
Unlike the current drop in Hollywood revenues, Netflix’s revenue from streaming reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too heavily on comic book franchises, and predicted Hollywood's "ghost."
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his dark predictions were partly true.
With several potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including "The Avengers: The Age of Altron", "Minions" and "South Park", other film industry representatives are more optimistic.
"People X" producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in box office revenues simply "cyclical", saying to the Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the most box office summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions do not frighten owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine Russian suppliers - it is a scary dream.
In general, the general public still prefers to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There is better a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella," says the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mario Valerio about the quality of cheeses offered to him by the suppliers in exchange for Italian ones.
Mosarella and Burrata cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they have a short storage period.
The reserves of parmesan should be enough for another couple of months.
What to do?
Switch to Russian?
In 2005 I was at the Dorogomilovsk market.
Mario Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear: shocking memories do not release him until now.
The meat was lying on the beds just 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything on the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe now everything has changed there.
But the other day I was brought fish from the Far East for a test.
So it turned out to be dull!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many ordinary things for Italy for the Russian manufacturer in the wilderness.
A few years ago I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is raised in a refrigerator for 10 days at 1-2 degrees Celsius.
It should hang to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then I was asked, "Where did you get such tender meat?"
I said, This is yours, Russians!
Why doesn't anyone do that?
Five minutes walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie bridge" in the kitchen hangs a stop-list which indicates the missing products: French oysters, sea urchin.
The chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Mост" and the bar "Strelka" Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already replaced oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses the restaurant will buy Swiss cheese.
However, Regis also becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Blue cape - 200 rubles!
I ask, "Why does it cost so much?"
They say, "Well, we also have to earn money."
But this cape should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far Eastern oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, imagine how much weight their panther?
At the price it turns out that it is superdelicate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of spices for foreign chefs.
Standard story: "For the first three months everything was fine, then the quality fell sharply".
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibre and quality.
Many restaurants of European cuisine do not know what will happen to them when the stocks of cheese are finished

Cancellation menus
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure Russia’s security, which are called mainly productive sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pork, meat and domestic poultry products, meat delicacies, fish, dairy products, milk, yogurt, curd, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, cabbages and sugar syrups.
Restaurant chains have begun to work with suppliers: prices for products have risen, it is urgent to look for similar products from other countries.
The strongest impact will be on expensive restaurants with mono-foods from France, Italy, Spain, where products were supplied directly from "maternal" countries.
The building had to be rebuilt earlier.
For example, in early 2014, Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In exchange, the suppliers arranged the supply of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the 2014 summer sanctions proved much more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, corn and onions for sowing.
Italian Valerio hopes that the sanctions can be further relaxed.
So far, some restaurants exist in uncertain conditions.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"Decent restaurants will have to change their menus to the ones produced by local farmers and other countries," says Sergei Mironov, restaurant owner and Resconсалt agency owner.
If the chef is strong, it will not be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such cooks, and it may take two to three months to develop a new menu.
"Brasserie bridge" is ready for this: you will have to give up 10-15% of meals, another half of the menu - rework.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine already start to replace dishes, such as steak from marble beef - to beefstrogans, says Sergei Mironov.
"Europe cheeses can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," says Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of East-West Company.
Molds and dairy products from Europe have similar products in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the USA can be replaced with chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and sage from Norway - salmon, sage, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget network restaurants will be easier to restructure than the premium segment: it is unlikely that there were gourmets able to distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian.
Although it will be difficult for Ginza Project institutions, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants with different brands and menus.
The replacement will take a lot of time," Mironov says.
Ginza refused to comment, citing the absence of owners in the country.
The owners of cafes of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine stress that products from the former Soviet republics are more fragrant than European
But there are plenty of restaurants that will not be subject to sanctions.
These include restaurants with cuisine from CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine," says Khatun Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and cafe "Wai Ma!".
All cheeses for us are made in Russia, the basis of many dishes - chicken fillet, exotic green we do not use".
No meals have been removed from the menu at Kolbai's establishments.
Timura Lansky, owner of "Chihona N1" restaurants with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions are not disturbing either: he will only have to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia arranges imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, - he says.
From the CIS it is cheaper to get cuts, lambs, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what is imported from Central Asia is much better than "plastics" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Everybody knows that Uzbek tomatoes are delicious and sweet.
No one speaks that way about Spanish.
Following the introduction of the sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, Ollimboy Artykov, said that he plans to double the export of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports to Russia almost immediately after the introduction of sanctions.
Fast food restaurants, which responded to the request of "Deneg", also quite calmly react to sanctions.
The press service of McDonald's stated that the localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, Head of the Department for Working with Subway Russia Suppliers, about 80% of the network’s products are purchased in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In "Teremka" "sanction products" in general occupied no more than 4%.
They did not touch sanctions and a piece of "Vokker".
KFC, Burger King and Pocket Money did not respond to Deneg's request, but other market participants claimed that Burger King's degree of localization was significantly lower than McDonald's's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish restaurants are ready to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far Eastern
On his mountaintop
Meanwhile, restaurants complain that due to the increase in demand, prices are rising even for local products.
"For Grable's products prices rose on average by 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant "Cherry Mio" - twice," - says the restaurant's restaurant manager Roman Рожnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants the cost of meals will increase by 5-10%, Kolbay admits.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have risen by 10-15% since the beginning of August."
"Brazilian suppliers have raised pig prices almost twice," complains Sergey Rak, Deputy Director General of Stardogs.
Corn chickens increased by 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, perhaps they will sweat hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8%.
Now and so it is very undesirable to raise prices, - says Rak.
According to the statistics, the growth of gross domestic product for the second quarter of 2014 - only 1.8%.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is unclear how quickly: as long as most restorers have stockpiled products for the next two months in hopes of waiting for price drops.
But no one knows what will happen in two months’ time.
On the square in front of the Moscow City Hall there are dozens of tents decorated with greenery and trees.
In the center of the stage, the musicians play the waltz.
It is a festival of regional products with the funny name "There is time to eat".
"In general, we were going to make a festival of local food for a long time, and here just sanctions, we rushed, organized the festival," - says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with the musicians, the Greek cook Anastasia prepares pasta salad and homemade confectionery, in the days there was a master class on the preparation of wrestling with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkortostan, lamb from Salehard, vegetables from the Moscow suburb of the "Sovhoza named after Lenin", cheeses from the overwhelmed Italian Jay Clouz.
"The salmon for restaurants can be easily replaced by another fish of salmon species from the Far East, - says the owner of the fish shop "Your People" Philip Galkin.
We are catching pearls, ketchup, whales, humpbacks, cabbage - "king salmon".
Yes, they are not as fat as Norwegian salmon because it is a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is the same aquaculture.
You take it in your hands - it doesn't even curl.
And you will not hold our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella domestic
In the window of his tent there are shrimp with tag "Magdan", fries, omul, mucus, midies from Crimea, shrimp from the Far East.
Galkin is convinced that it is long overdue to switch to fishing from the Far East.
According to statistics, fish catches in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, much of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even to the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 - about 800 thousand tons.
Lavka "Your People" has been operating since 2012, selling fish through an online shop, before the introduction of the sanctions served another one and a half dozen restaurants, such as "Simplified things".
Currently, 15 more restaurants have submitted applications to the Gallery.
The same soil can be made of our fish, - it heats up.
We were frozen, tried different recipes.
Now we sell dried fruit through the online shop for a million rubles per month.
Our fish is several times cheaper, and shipping - it is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In confirmation in the Galkin shuttle I prepare a portion of "Philippines" with ketchup.
Unlike rollers with sage, these have to hunt longer, but the awareness that this fish is ours, domestic, adds strength.
On the site of the shop "Your People" there are even rolls of pallet and sea oak.
In sushi bars, however, the Norwegian salmon is preferred to Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains this by the fact that chefs are lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
"Russian fish suppliers have not offered us yet", - explains owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseev.
The same situation applies to other products: Russian producers could take over the liberated niche, but this does not happen.
According to Boris Akimov, founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project, it is now possible to talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace banned imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, large producers of other countries will benefit from the ban," Akimov says.
Last month, however, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than the food sanctions.
Following the results of mass unscheduled inspections of Rosneprnadzor, the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the essence of the claims filed to determine the actions necessary for the immediate opening of restaurants for visitors," - said "Denгам" in the McDonald's press service.
In fact, no one understands what will happen next.
If everything is restricted to product sanctions, it is one option that can survive, - says the employee of the restaurant consulting company on the condition of anonymity.
But if McDonald's starts to close across the country, the scenario will be completely different.
"Europrotokol" instead of the traffic police directory
Cash payments can be received without the guidance of the traffic police - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction in Russia of "Europrotocol".
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft instructions according to which from September 1 of this year, in order to receive cash payments for the insured car driver will be able to do without the assistance of the traffic police.
It is true that this is only the case when the accident was registered on the "Europrotocol" without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if there were only two cars involved in the accident, there were no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the limit and both drivers reached agreement on who was responsible for the accident.
From August 2, the limit of payments for Europrotocol is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1, in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad regions it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The point is that often, even with minor damages, in situations where an accident can be registered by "Europrotocol", drivers, caught in an accident, call the police.
After all, it was not possible to get compensation for it without the assistance of the traffic police in the presence of a cash register.
The parameters specified in the draft guidelines are intended to remove this obstacle on the way to the introduction of the "Europrotocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum cash payment in connection with traffic accidents, issued without the police officers, should not be lower than the limit on "Europrotocol".
At the same time, however, it cannot be higher than the limit specified in the insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically able to unload both the staff of the DFS and the roads.
But it is likely that neither car makers nor insurers will be delighted by it.
The latter already speak of a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could result from the introduction of new rules on cash payments.
As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for hours for the inspector to make a small accident, because it is more reliable.
And it is not yet known what will be easier - to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers in the reliability of "Europrotokol".
The Saving Certificate will make it unique and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates on depositors, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of a non-refundable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will prohibit savings certificates on the applicant.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as the rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that savings certificates for the depositor do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank as there is no need to make deductions to the fund of the Deposit Insurance Agency (DBA).
The pity of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and the Sberbank and Bank of Moscow will suffer from it, which, according to ASV estimates, control 98% of the profile market.
And the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency estimates, is about 3.5%.
The problem, the ASV explains, is that customers of a small bank, who bought such a certificate, in case of withdrawal of the license from it try to get money in the ASV.
Some investors, who do not have sufficient financial literacy and purchase savings certificates from a predecessor, may assume that their investments are insured.
Reasonable absence of insurance payments on these certificates in case of withdrawal of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency there were cases where holders of certificates of presentation tried to seek insurance compensation through the court," the ASV said.
The problem is, of course, deliberate.
After all, nobody will pay the buyers of certificates anyway, because they do not have the right to compensation from the state by law.
If it were the case that the instrument is not insured in ASV, together with it would be banned metal accounts, on which citizens' funds are taken into account in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but for their existence until now no one attempts.
The fact is that certificates on the forwarder are a very convenient securities, which can actually act as quasi-denominations.
Their movement is virtually uncontrolled: any bank customer can buy a certificate, pass it on to any citizen, and many owners can change the certificate before it is cashed out.
It is no coincidence that the bill stipulates that a savings certificate must be a specific securities that must be stored in a depository.
And to send the pill to the banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of early repayment.
That is, an analogue of a non-refundable deposit that bankers have long dreamed of is introduced.
NATO Summit: First protests in Nuremberg and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests against the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff about 150 people gathered at Cardiff Town Hall for what was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Faircrew followed the developments over the weekend and spoke to protesters who came from all over the world, from Bridenda to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter terrorists from the Islamic State group, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31 with reference to the decision taken following the meeting of representatives of the German government headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
According to reports, Germany will send to Iraq 30 portable anti-tank missile complexes "Milan" and 500 charges to them, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The shipments will be carried out by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian aid.
On September 1, Mrs Merkel will address the Bundestag with a government statement on the subject.
So far Germany has not delivered its weapons to "hot spots".
The Germans disagreed about sending weapons to the Iraqis.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop fighters from the "Islamic State", others fear that this weapon may end up in the hands of terrorists.
Soldiers killed Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
Donetsk militia attacked a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31.
According to the available data, this occurred in the Taganrog Bay near settlements Широкino and Bezыменное (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports about the shooting of two shore guard boats.
It is noted that the incident occurred today about 16:20 PM.
Teenagers were taken by helicopter from Blue Mountains
Two bushucker teenagers were transported by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man set out on a hike shortly after midday on Sunday at the Hovetts Lip in Blackhite.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team, including local police and a rescue team, was dispatched and the couple were found around 11pm near the Braidal Way Falls.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and broke his head.
The officers stayed with the couple for the night, and they were picked up on the bench on Monday morning.
They were taken by a stable ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two alliances met
The negotiations at the highest level in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were called, but created a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future of Eurasian
For the first time, the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed a number of “hot issues” despite the disturbing situation (the situation around Ukraine is not tolerated).
Whether such a structure is capable of functioning effectively is unclear; however, it is clear who took the sleeves off this summit.
On the evening of 26 August, Belarusians, followed by other Eurasians and Europeans, saw the new President Lukashenko on TV news.
The Belarusian leader gave an example of careful politeness, it was the behavior of a man who has just broken a jackpot - and plans a decent old age in the upper society.
How Maidan Lukashenko helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European Commissioners (EU ministers), who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf, is not just the legitimacy of the president with 20 years of experience.
It is a declaration to recognise Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies Denis Melyantsov is sure that Brussels will no longer be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met with Lukashenko one by one gives grounds to believe that relations with the EU will continue to be discussed," he told "Ognika".
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for the breakdown of the Belarusian authorities began long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"Results have been achieved and with the EU - it is successful negotiations on visa regime simplification and re-admission, dialogues on modernization, - the interlocutor "Ogonka" lists, - and negotiations on international security were held with the US.
The states even lifted a few sanctions.
As far as the Ukrainian events are concerned, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them have only undermined this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and urged to punish the pro-Russian militias in Donbass with all severity, did not argue with Moscow either.
Minsk has not left either the Customs Union or the CSTO, and a Russian airbase is located in Baranovichy.
Brussels and Washington noted Minsk's balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated it, Belarusian experts are sure.
The success of Lukashenko’s move towards political diversification will be seen by how often Minsk will be able to hold meetings in the EU+TS format in the near future.
The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expects from relations in the new format.
Ashton's press secretary Maya Kosyanchich only told "Ogonka" that this issue is not a priority in the light of the resolution of war and peace issues.
At the same time there were reports that Kazakhstan could become the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s statement, in which he admitted that he was personally asked to do so by representatives of the European Union, was the key to Minsk.
At the final briefing, however, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all sides are not against Minsk remaining the central venue for meetings in the Russia-ECB-Ukraine format, as well as at the level of Heads of State and High Representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” will gain the status of a fully committed European leader, helping to solve the global problem.
The best friend of the European farmer
Already the composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, pointed to the conclusion: the main background of the summit is not the tragic situation in Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the schedule of future negotiations on gas supplies and overcoming the concerns of the CIS countries regarding Ukraine’s association with the EU appears to be a larger achievement than peaceful declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Karl De Gucht, however, noted: EU representatives "have come to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis, which has economic consequences, and not vice versa".
It seems, however, that the economic crisis in Ukraine also "works" on Belarus.
Its consequences – and, above all, the mutual sanctions between the West and Russia – give Minsk, which itself is under sanctions pressure, a long-awaited field of maneuver.
According to the head of the Science and Research Center of Mises, former candidate for President of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus’ possibilities for supplying agricultural products to the Russian Federation to circumvent sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin at the summit burned Minsk.
“The initiators of these schemes are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies,” Romanchuk said.
They have long worked out schemes of supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
Russian business urgently needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies cannot help but set up production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with orientation to the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers export about 4 billion dollars to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes can now prove very in demand."
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the platform for negotiations between the EU and the CIS is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has currently offered only 125 million euros compensation to farmers.
The Belarusian president can offer Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for euro farmers.
This could raise Lukashenko’s credibility in the EU to unprecedented heights.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk is being disconnected from its active role in the birth of the ТС+EU format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart stressed that Kiev was the initiator of the new format.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any hesitation to discuss, not from the bay to take a decision, after signing the Association Treaty with the EU, to understand the situation that was at that moment in Ukraine," he addressed in front of the cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which was originally reportedly opposed to Minsk’s mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic office, it is emphasized that Belarus does not pursue crude goals when organizing cooperation between the EU and the CIS on its land, but the ultimate goal of such a format is the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that in other spheres, in particular in the security sphere, promotes and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation," - said Ogonka in the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a department where recently the words are carefully selected.
There may be areas with paid entry in Moscow
The government of Moscow considers the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of combating overcrowding of central roads by analogy with other major cities of the world, transmits M24.ru with reference to the Mayor of Moscow on transport matters Maxim Likutov.
One of the options that has successfully proved itself is paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, look at all the pros and cons.
It is not too early to say that some decisions have been taken in this regard,” Lixсутov said.
Zammara stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and loading to Moscow, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the construction of the central ring road, he added.
The newly started construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that not all traffic must pass through Moscow.
If there were sufficient infrastructure for transit, there would be no need to have transit traffic in Moscow,” the Deputy Mayor noted.
Maxim Lekсутov also stated that the introduction of paid parking lots significantly overloaded the capital streets.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at the achieved.
Recall, on August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital Sergey Sobyanin participated in the ceremony of the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CKAD).

The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez "City of Sins-2: A Woman Who Should Be Killed" did not bring about the revolution that could have been expected of it.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), shot with the minimal but symbolic participation of Quintino Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between film, comics and literary noir.
Sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it breaks down the fundamental chain of modern thinking "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if you understand under the thesis the universe of zero, and under thesis the cosmos of comics).
From now on it should read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
"City of Sins-2" is chaotic both on the dramatic and on the philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the stupid sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar from the first "City", although, here, Marv (Micky Rurk), remembered, ended life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to catch - in the role of this popular wives - from the air knives and other tops with pushers.
But the old people are literally shaken by the elbows of the newcomers, as if they had slipped into the city from some other film, about the meaning and the plot of which the viewers are asked not to worry.
So, his own story, shamelessly interrupted by the authors in the most interesting place, at the super-successful player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Hers is with the greedy frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something moving to her Duet (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, let's say, face is not distinguished from Johnny - all the more so that faces, like other parts of the body, are borne by characters with unbelievable regularity, - not misery and even not victory.
These are not people, but we understand that these are the archetypes of Nuar: rocky suck, too self-confident player, satisfied in the "metal trap" of sex detective, corrupt whistle-blower senator.
Well, and when the archetype wrestles with the archetype and the archetype drives, it is no longer a film, but rather an abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is simply funny.
Moreover, even in this turbulent world there is something permanent.
The battleships from the first "City" still hold round defense from the occupying their native slums forces of darkness.
And the ghost of detective Hartigan is not-no, and he will look at the fence, and Bruce Willis is always pleasant to look at.
The main problem of the City of Sins-2 is another.
Frank Miller was good in that as a painter talentedly combined comics and noir, and as a director - turned the idea of how to bring comics to the screen.
Comics and Noir are two aggressively opposite "realities".
The phenomenon of comics in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, when the novels of Dashel Hammet "The Bloody Harvest" (1929), "The Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of Nuar, then hard-boiled school - "the red school".
Well or pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the sailor Poppy - the hunter of the spider giving him rich power, Superman, Batman and the spy Dick Tracy to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other " Avengers".
But in any comic film there was something damaged: the drawn characters persistently did not want to turn into screen clowns, remained pretenders in their surrounding "real" world.
In short, they were completely deprived of "existence".
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional novel - with its experiences, characteristics, family scandals and historical background - lost all credibility.
What Forsyths, what Tibo and Rugon Mackaras, what even Bolconsk and Rostov are thought of after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into the format of a soap opera, and criminal - i.e. by definition marginal - novel rose to the level of philosophical praise.
Hammet learned what it was like to work as a sanitary worker on the front.
He was a communist.
As, by the way, were at least close to the Communist Party and such genre pillars as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Loузи, Edward Dmitryk.
Therefore, the animal, whose archetype they proposed, on the one hand, is crude and cynical, and on the other - totally social.
It is almost an American version of social realism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely because it unnaturally but organically combined the comic with theнуар.
For the first time on the screen the comics lived, no shyness of its graphic nature, rather than pretending to be a "real" movie.
The darkness of the sales world, where the cardinal ordered murders and the senator covered the monstrous son-садista, was quite worthy of Hammet's pen.
And picturesque details like cut heads, with which the gardener decorated his nest, the pen of the genius James Ellroy, the author of "Black Orchid" and the best - i.e., declaratively smelly - representative of neonurture.
"City of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but a capitulation to Miller-Rodriguez's radical style before the comic tradition.
Probably, in large part, this happened because of 3D technologies.
When you look at the second "City of Sins", you feel trapped in a glass ball in which snow melts a toy cloak.
However, most often it is not snow, but bloody scars, but on the whole what is the difference?
There is nothing to say about sociality.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere in our country sometimes, even on the other side of a dirty marsh, but there is a normal world, where you can return a girl who walked along a curved road or, say, tell unsuspecting parents that her loser is punished.
But when there is no place for sin in the city except for sin, then sin is no longer sin, but the norm.
Delicious, like any norm.
The chaos of "City of Sins-2" is simply silent.
For the sake of justice, the domestic rent has given this press sin a small, but pearl.
The titles warn: the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
With regard to the spectacle, in the very vegetarian episode where a man's fingers are broken by shields, it gives hell humor.
Hammett would like it.
France's Socialists must "get together and put France in order," says the key ally of François Hollande
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left to "show warm affection" for the attacked Socialist President, whose changes did not find the approval of the overwhelming majority of French.
The President deserves the respect of everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay close to him," he said, applauding.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite fiercely conflicting proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland prayed to his Socialist Party colleagues to remain "unified" with the government.
However, Christian Tober, Minister of Justice, put the sticks in the wheels when he came to the Socialist Party's unanimous parliamentary assembly and criticized the Socialist Party for allowing the French "to lose faith in the future".
Marine Le Pe, leader of the far-right National Front, condemned the continuing internal conflicts among socialists, saying she did not think that Wallis' new government would last longer than a few months.
François Hollande is a naked king, but a naked and Prince Manuel Vall, forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last the summer.
"And the new one won't last autumn or winter either," Mrs. Le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the parliament to be dissolved, saying that she was confident the party could easily win early elections and was ready to govern.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the May EU elections.
A survey by Sunday’s Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French believe that the Socialist Party risks splitting into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Hollande’s presidency in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Cincinnati, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
"City without drugs" remained without a claim
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed the appeal of the Administrative Directorate of the Regional Ministry for Housing Management to the "City Without Drugs" Fund.
The agency intended to collect from the organization more than 7 million rubles as a rent for the building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the defendant did not appear in court twice.
Today the Arbitration Court of Sverdlovsk Oblast left without consideration the application of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry for the Management of State Property of the Region (MUGISO) to the "City without Drugs" Foundation (one of the founders - Yekaterinburg Mayor Yevgeny Royzman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect from the organization 7.3 million rubles as a rent for the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff did not appear twice in court, which is why the decision on refusal of consideration was taken.
The reason of the absence of representatives in the management of MUGISO could not be explained, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer the telephone calls.
The representatives of the foundation also failed to contact.
Recall, it is about the mansion, which occupied the fund in the center of the city on Belinsky Street, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
This decision was made by former Governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the administrative department of the Ministry of State Property Management of Sverdlovsk Oblast filed a lawsuit against the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court for the removal of the fund from the building.
According to the appeal, the department demanded through the court to recognize the unencumbered contract of free use of the premises of the memorial mansion.
According to the management of MUGISO, the agreement did not contain substantial conditions for leasing the cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsk arbitration court rejected the suit, then an appeal was lodged in the 17th Perry arbitration court, which was satisfied.
Then in the same court the fund filed a cassation complaint on this decision, which remained unsatisfactory, after which the decision was appealed by the fund in the High Court of Arbitration, but the court took the side of the Directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded, under which the fund again began to pay rent, the head of the city Evgeny Royzman told about it.
The rent was set at 300 thousand rubles per month.
The previous administration of the region handed over this building to us for free use, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, in recognition of the Foundation.
The current administration has decided differently,” he said.

Why the Mayor of Yekaterinburg was offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24, a deputy of Yekaterinburg's parliament, Uniross Alexander Kosinets, proposed to the city mayor - speaker of the parliament Yevgeny Raisman to resign.
The reason for this was a criminal case against Oleg Kinev, a member of the parliament who was arrested on suspicion of murdering a retired member of the parliament, who is considered a friend of the mayor.
How Eugene Raisman was found guilty
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of "clemency" (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of Yekaterinburg Mayor Yevgeny Rosman.
This was reported in the State Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Sverdlovsk Oblast, where Anna Filatova, Director General of the Legal Center "Protection" applied with the corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roseman accused her in his blog entries that she was involved in crimes allegedly committed by her former spouse.
The Mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is yet another attempt to retaliate for the truth".
iPhone will turn into a wallet
In the run-up to September 9, when Apple is due to present its new developments, there are all new leaks in the press about what can be expected from the presentation.
The sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project of Apple and the payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and specialized website Re/code, at the presentation of new products September 9, Apple can announce, among other things, a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which the new smartphone iPhone 6 will be available mobile wallet function.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this.
This feature allows you to make a payment at the store cashier with the help of a smartphone.
Payment identification will be performed by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be the first to integrate NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows to make contactless payment using a smartphone and corresponding reading device at the cashier.
NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC feature was first introduced in 2004 as part of the collaboration of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that joined the so-called NFC Forum - an association to promote this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC functionality - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, allowing users to attach bank cards to their Google account and pay using a smartphone on Android.
However, U.S. experts stress that despite high-tech companies’ large investments in promoting NFC technology, U.S. retailers are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on their store equipment with such systems.
So now observers hope that Apple’s entry into this market will still make retailers accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their outlets.
MFA of France: Paris's position regarding the supplies to Russia of "Masters" does not change
The official representative of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs Romen Nadal stated that Paris's position regarding Russia's delivery of helicopters of the type "Master" remains unchanged.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Hollande) in an interview with Le Monde newspaper on 20 August: "Today, the level of sanctions does not impede the supply.
This is the decision of Europeans, not of France," - Mr Nadal quotes "RIA News".
Thus, the representative of the French Foreign Ministry answered the question whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will not be affected by the change of the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract

Norwegian Cruise approaches $3-million deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise ships and supplies to Prestige Cruises customers, as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced as early as this week, sources said Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources have asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations are not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the request to comment, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income amounted to $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 percent more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 percent higher than a year earlier.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India in the years to come.
Companies in the race seek to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with the U.S. regulatory authority for the initial public offering of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's main shareholder after a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it exists today, in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a entertainment and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Tai.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owns a 28 percent stake, Apollo owns a 20 percent stake, and TPG Capital LP owns an 8 percent stake in the company, as of the end of June, according to reports.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of cruise passenger traffic in North America, according to registration documents at the first public offering of shares of Prestige Cruises.

Hong Kong Democratic Movement activists delay Chinese representative’s speech the following day after the election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Assembly on Sunday determined the procedure under which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in Hong Kong’s presidential elections in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of the majority of members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision made it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get into the ballot box and forced activists of the democratic movement to promise again to stop Hong Kong's financial center with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing’s publication of a document describing China’s control of Hong Kong in June, activists of the democratic movement held an unofficial referendum on elections in the Special Administrative Region, and hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business center and held a sit-down strike.
Li's briefing is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Bureau for Relations in Hong Kong.
Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Assembly Zhang Longshun and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau State Council Office Feng Wei were also scheduled to speak at a series of briefings during the day.
Student activists said they would gather at the Hong Kong government headquarters in the second half of the day.
The United Kingdom did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to add 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to add 400 hectares of land on the western bank of the Jordan River, belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to BBC, the decision to join the land of South Bethlehem is linked to the desire to pay for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June of this year.
On Sunday, the Israeli Defense Ministry announced the seizure of the territory and instructed the military to establish administrative control over the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saiba Arikka, the world community should call on Israel to respond to "the continued settlement activity on the West Bank and East Jerusalem".
Putin demands Kiev to start negotiations on "statehood" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the divided region.
His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to suggest that Eastern Ukraine territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking region the opportunity to defend its rights and interests.
But Putin’s call to the Kiev government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equals was in line with the obvious strategy he has followed since the bloodshed began five months ago: Help the separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of New Russia real independence in order to come closer to Russia, not the West.
In an interview with the state's First TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently named the occupied territories New Russia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peaceful negotiations will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians start campaigns for the 26 October parliamentary elections and while government troops attack peaceful settlements in regions held by separatists, is a "prisoner of illusions", ITAR-TASS reported.
"We must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to respect the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin's words about statehood were in the context of broader autonomy, which was discussed during months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
It is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the Kremlin's press secretary to correct Putin's "false interpretation" of the words underscored the Russian leadership's decision to treat the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much more difficult battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and polls prior to the conflict showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, transferring to the Kremlin actual control over territory that would connect Russia’s main territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, joined five months ago, is home to the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical maritime resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea there are also mines, factories and iron works that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislators after the new elections should weigh constitutional amendments allowing to give the separated regions greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and separatist insurgents, accused of arming and instigating Moscow.
Putin’s latest call to Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals followed renewed rebel attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
Supported by Russia, the separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk in an attack, which Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory to the Crimea itself.
This resulted in large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Novoazovsky and a narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of irreversible," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; leaders called for a draft of tougher sanctions against Russia that would be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 soldiers entered Donetsk region last week to support separatists experiencing difficulties, Colonel Andrey Lysenko, the press secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers who are reportedly detained in Ilovaysk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airborne pilots captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Scandal with revealed photos captures Australian celebrities and Gaby Greco
Jeffrey Edelstein expressed his disgust with hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his bride Gaby Greco and a list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is upset after a series of revealing photographs of Jennifer Lawrence naked appeared on the Internet as a result of a large-scale celebrity hacking scandal.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 revealed photographs of the star of "Voice Games" Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Kara Delevin, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lisa Michel and actress Kirsten Danst.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Fearovski and Melbourne resident Greco were also allegedly stolen photos as a result of escaping from iCloud.
In the list of 101 names of celebrities.
Edelstein, who made Greece's offer last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photos must remain private.
It is unfortunate that personal information can be stolen and disclosed to other people.
Greece, who is based in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacking attack was "shameful" and that those to whom it was directed "feel that they have been invaded".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photographs of Palmer with former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying by the pool with her naked chest.
Palmer's films include Love and Honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of the movie "Chak" Fearovski and actress from "Prohibited reception" Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen photos.
Representative Lawrence told TMZ: "This is a brutal invasion of private life."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his displeasure at the hacker, writing on Twitter: "Posting photos stolen from a mobile phone, in fact, is nothing different from selling stolen goods."
Simply from a legal point of view, you cannot tolerate the publication of stolen photographs.
Potential way of stealing photos of naked celebrities discovered
The massive hacking of star accounts may have been caused by a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential development scenario was described by The Next Web.
A Python script was published on Github that allowed users to choose passwords for Apple's Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
To access it, the same Apple ID and login connection is used as for accessing the Apple iCloud cloud from which celebrity photos were stolen.
The script allows you to retrieve passwords from Find My Phone.
In this method, all possible combinations of characters are entered sequentially, starting with the most frequently used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that in the service Find My Phone the number of password options to be entered is unlimited.
If the security system is properly organized after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be blocked and notified to the user of the attempted breach.
Due to the vulnerability, users did not receive any messages about attempting to find a password for their account.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a Twitter message from Hackapp user, the vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and to it written a scripting program for password retrieval.
The vulnerability is currently closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The source contacted the Hackapp user and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is characteristic of many services, however he noted that there is no evidence that such a vulnerability was used to access the Star account.
This is not me, Plz RT
On Twitter of the Prime Minister has once again appeared the external entries
Although there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has already been a wave of malicious actions using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In this case, Apple stated to the media that cloud security was not compromised in this case, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's Twitter was also previously hacked.
If the attackers had access to the iCloud described above, the password to the head of government account in the microblogging service could also be stored there.
The Next Web did not receive Apple's comments about the vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian five-ball team
President of Russia Vladimir Putin has granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anne Buryak.
The corresponding decree is published on the Internet portal of legal information.
At the beginning of this year the athlete moved to Russia for a permanent residence and appealed to the Federation of modern five-борья with a request to provide her opportunity to act for the national team of Russia.
In 2013, she won two World Cup stages, won the silver medal of the European Championships in personal superiority and became the world champion in mixed relay, which is one of the new types of program in this sport.
She remains in the lead for the current season.
According to the rules, to perform at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, she will need to obtain special permission of the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue Russian passport to chess player Ekaterina Lagno - a native of Lviv, who is twice the champion of Europe (2005, 2008), the lightweight world (2010) and fast chess (2014).
As part of the women's team of Ukraine, the athlete became the winner of the Chess Olympiad in Turin (2006), the team championship in Astana (2013) and the team championship of Europe in Warsaw (2013).
NKR ends investigation of Tu-204 crash in Vnukovo
The Russian Investigative Committee (CRC) has terminated the criminal case on the fact of the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft of Red Wings.
This is reported by the press service of the Ministry.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the aircraft's commander and pilot.
Judicial examination revealed that the cause of the crash was the increased landing speed, the crew's failure to comply with standard landing procedures, as well as the unintended output of the engines to the increased torque of direct gravity.
Red Wings' Tu-204 aircraft, which was flying from Prague to Moscow, crashed on 29 December 2012 at Vnukovo Moscow Airport.
The aircraft flew over the runway and caught fire.
At the scene of the accident, the commander of the aircraft, the second pilot and the pilot were killed.
Two wrestlers were transported to medical institutions, where they later died of injuries received.
Three more pilots, hospitalized with severe bodily damage, underwent long-term treatment.
In addition, heavy bodily injuries were sustained by the driver of the car driving at the time of the crash on the Kiev highway.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
After the accident, the Transport Prosecutor's Office conducted an inspection at Red Wings, which revealed numerous violations.
In February 2013, the airline's license was suspended.

Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional emotion of man
The serious expression of the face is biologically universal for mankind, and everyone involved in its creation organ and muscle group is not accidental, but is an additional means of expression of power and threat, scientists from Australia and the United States found.
Their discoveries were reported in Evolution and Human Behavior magazine, and can be read briefly in the press release of the University of California, Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - bent and lowered cheeks, stretched into a thin line of lips, distorted nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and makes it even blind from birth children who have never seen it, says lead author of the study Aaron Sell.
Within the framework of a major research project devoted to the nature of anger, scientists discovered that this emotion has arisen for effective dispute resolution during conflict.
The more physical damage one person can cause to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his conditions, and he brings it to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
The researchers found confirmations of another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to be angry and switch to manuals, consider themselves entitled to impose unfavourable conditions on others, and prefer violent methods of peaceful conflict resolution.
Reflecting on the fact that anger is primarily a "trading emotion," the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create the angry expression of the face should make the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus force him to agree with his conditions as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, researchers modeled the face on a computer, where each of the seven elements of the angry face existed or lacked, and showed them to informants.
Although the lowered cheeks or forward raised chins alone did not make the face evil, the person depicted with such features was more physically strong, the researchers unanimously acknowledged.
Human anger, like animal anger, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one’s own power, forcing one to agree and submit.
A man blows his nostrils and presses his lips with the same purpose as a frog that blows, or a grandmother that shows off her tail.
"The anger "is triggered" by the interlocutor's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form, most effectively demonstrating to the opposite side the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry face is arbitrary, they all express the same,” said anthropologist John Tubi.
